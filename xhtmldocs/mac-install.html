                  Apple appears to have shipped a buggy version of
                  X11 with 10.5. The problem appears fixed in
                  10.5.6 (It may have been fixed earlier, but I
                  don't have a machine on which I can test that).

                  <p>The problem only affects fontforge it if uses
                  pango or cairo.</p>

                  <p>This release of fontforge tries to check for a
                  buggy system, and if it thinks it is running on
                  one, then it will refuse to use Pango and
                  Cairo.</p>

                  <p>The problem does not affect Mac 10.4.*</p>
                  <hr />
                  You may upgrade from 10.5 to 10.5.6 by going to
                  the Apple Menu and selecting the "Software
                  Update" menu item, and then the "Mac OS X Update
                  Combined".

                  <p>You probably need to install X11
                  <strong>before</strong> you upgrade the Operating
                  System.</p>

      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>The X server lives in a package called X11User.pkg in
          the Packages folder on the third install CD.</li>

          <li>Just double click on this file and follow its
          instructions to install X11</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>You may also want to install the <a href=
    "http://fink.sourceforge.net/">fink</a> or <a href=
    "http://www.macports.org/">macports</a> packages which includes
    many useful libraries (see the <a href=
    "source-build.html#Dependencies">dependencies</a> section below
    for more info on this)</p>

    <h5><a name="Configuring-X11" id=
    "Configuring-X11">Configuring</a> X11</h5>

    <p><code>X11-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Input</code></p>

    <p>FontForge is designed to make use of a three button mouse.
    It is also designed to make use of modifier key modes on mouse
    clicks (so Control left click can mean something different than
    left click). If you have a three (or two) button mouse then use
    it (and turn off "<code>Emulate three button mouse</code>" in
    the X11 preferences). If you have a standard one button mouse
    then you have the option of having the mac simulate a three
    button mouse (for instance Option mouse click behaves like
    clicking the middle mouse button). Unfortunately this means you
    can no longer use the Option key to change the behavior of the
    left (only) button click. So either choice means you lose
    capabilities.</p>

    <p>Normally X11 is configured so that the Command key
    (cloverleaf) is bound to the X11 menu bar, and not to
    fontforge's. When fontforge starts it checks this, and if X11
    gets command then fontforge configures its menubar to use
    Control rather than command. This isn't very mac-like. If you
    turn <b>off</b> the "<code>Enable keyboard shortcuts under
    X11</code>" preference item then fontforge will configure its
    menubar to make use of Command.</p>

    <p>If type the following into a terminal (or xterm) window</p>

    <blockquote id="shell">
      <pre>
<span class="c4">$ </span>cat &gt;~/.fonts.conf
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd"&gt;
&lt;!-- /etc/fonts/fonts.conf file to configure system font access --&gt;
&lt;fontconfig&gt;

&lt;!-- Font directory list --&gt;
&lt;!-- Add to system list --&gt;

        &lt;dir&gt;/System/Library/Fonts&lt;/dir&gt;
        &lt;dir&gt;/Library/Fonts&lt;/dir&gt;
        &lt;dir&gt;~/Library/Fonts&lt;/dir&gt;

&lt;/fontconfig&gt;
<b>^D</b>
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>then fontforge's UI will be able to use the fonts Apple
    supplies with the mac. (You don't type the "$", and ^D means
    hold down the control key and press "D").</p>

    <h5>Note:</h5>

    <p>On the mac, the Option key is mapped to what fontforge calls
    "Alt" or "Meta".</p>

    <h3><a name="Obtaining" id="Obtaining">Obtaining</a> one of my
    pre-built packages</h3>

    <p>I used to post mac install packages on <a href=
    "http://sourceforge.net/projects/fontforge/files/">sourceforge's
    file release system</a>. The old ones are still there
    <strong>but they are now out of date.</strong> There's a
    certain amount of pother involved in using the file release
    system, but you get the file eventually.</p>

    <p>I currently post builds for Mac 10.5 &amp; 10.4 (I post
    different builds for the two systems because they provide
    different python libraries).</p>

    <p><strong>Neither of these builds will work on 10.3</strong>.
    If you wish a 10.3 build you can <a href=
    "source-build.html">build from current source</a>, or download
    a build from 2006. If you wish a 10.2 or earlier build the
    current sources will not work and you must delve more deeply
    into the past.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If you follow the <a href=
      "http://sourceforge.net/projects/fontforge/files/">link
      above</a> you will end up on a page showing many releases of
      FontForge for many systems<br />
      in most cases you will want the most recent release.</li>

      <li>Then click on the executable package you want to
      download:

        <ul>
          <li>The mac release will be called something like
          "FontForge-200xxxxx.pkg.sitx</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Then you have the joy of choosing a mirror site (pick one
      that's on the same continent you are) and click on the little
      icon in the download column</li>

      <li>Then you wait. After a bit you get another copy of this
      same page. After an even longer time your browser notices
      that you've started a download.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="install" id="install">Installing</a></h3>

    <p>Generally your browser will decompress the package after
    pulling it down, and then start the install process itself.</p>

    <p>If this doesn't happen, find the package (it's usually on
    the desktop) and double-click on it.</p>

    <p>The install will request your password (to make sure you
    have the right to do an install on your machine, and then ask
    some innocuous questions, and proceed to install.</p>

    <h3><a name="Notes" id="Notes">Notes</a></h3>

    <p>FontForge does not conform to Apple's Human Interface
    Guidelines. FontForge never will. Don't expect it to look like
    a normal Mac Application. It doesn't.</p>

    <p>Before you can start FontForge you must start the X11
    server. You do this by opening the Utilities sub-folder of the
    Applications folder and double-clicking on X11. This will bring
    up a new menu bar, and under the Applications menu you should
    find an entry for FontForge.</p>
