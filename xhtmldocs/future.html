    <h2>Currently under development</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Moving to the gtk-2 widget set.

        <ul>
          <li>Don't expect anything soon. I don't find this an
          interesting task. One widget set is much like another,
          such a conversion is a lot of work and doesn't involve
          any functional improvement. (Indeed I am currently
          ignoring this because gdk is <em>less</em> capable of
          dealing with images than my own drawing system -- at
          least in the ways that matter to me, and I don't want to
          rewrite all my image code)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>A command that will allow you to (but this has been
      listed here for a couple of years so don't expect anything
      much)

        <ul>
          <li>Make a character/font bolder</li>

          <li>Extend or Condense a character/font</li>

          <li>Change the X-Height of a font</li>

          <li>Regularize stem widths</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Musings</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>multiple baseline support</li>

      <li>Vertical metrics in embedded ttf bitmaps</li>

      <li>Better import of xfig files (a real X-Spline -&gt; BÃ©zier
      spline converter)</li>

      <li>Mechanism for creating fonts with multiple instances of
      the same character, each slightly different, coupled with a
      postscript routine which will for each character in a string,
      pick a random version of that character to display. An
      attempt to yield a slight non-uniformity to the font which
      may make its output look more interesting.</li>

      <li>A better way of aligning things. (need some form of
      grouping that is actually useful)</li>
    </ul>
