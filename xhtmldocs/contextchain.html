    <h1>Editing Contextual or Chaining Contextual lookups</h1>

    <h2>What is a Contextual Positioning lookup?</h2>

    <p>There are two types of contextual positioning modes:
    Contextual Positioning and Chained Contextual Positioning. In
    the simplest form of the first you may specify a list glyphs
    and specify repositioning to occur if that sequence is matched.
    For example you might specify (in English)<br />
    <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5 t h</code><br />
    and if that sequence were found raise the "t" and "h" to
    5<sup>th</sup>. You can also specify classes of glyphs so you
    could say something like:<br />
    <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [0-9] t h</code><br />
    to raise "t" and "h" after any digit.</p>

    <p>After applying this lookup, a word processor will skip over
    the three glyphs matched by the pattern, at least it will in a
    simple "Contextual Positioning" lookup. The "Chained Contextual
    Positioning" lookup is a bit more general and allows you to
    divide the pattern into three parts: A part before the current
    glyph (called backtracking), a part including the current
    glyph, and a part after the current glyph (called lookahead).
    Positioning changes may only be made to the part including the
    current glyph, and the word processor will advance by the
    number of glyphs in that subset of the pattern.</p>

    <h2>What is a Contextual Substitution lookup?</h2>

    <p>Substitutions come in three types. The first two are similar
    to the two types for positioning, the third is designed to
    handle a very specific case of arabic typography and is applied
    backwards.</p>

    <p>Suppose you had a script font where most letters join at the
    base line, but after some letters (b,o,v,w) the join is near
    the x-height, so a special version of each lower case letter
    needs to be created designed for a left side join near the
    x-height. You would want to be able to say:<br />
    <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [bovw] [a-z]</code><br />
    Note that this just specifies the cases in which the
    substitution may be applied. It does not specify the
    substitution itself, that is done in a separate lookup.</p>

    <p>You may pull down an example script font with this
    substitution from <a href=
    "http://fontforge.sf.net/sfds/FormalScript.tgz">FormalScript.tgz</a>,
    this example is worked out in detail in the <a href=
    "editexample6-5.html#Conditional">tutorial</a>.</p>

    <h2>More complete descriptions</h2>

    <h2>How do these relate to Apple Advanced Typography
    features?</h2>

    <p>In some cases a contextual or chaining contextual
    substitution can be converted into one of Apple's contextual
    glyph substitution subtables. See the page on <a href=
    "gposgsub.html#sometimes">Apple Advanced Typography</a> for
    more information as to when and caveats about how.</p>

    <h2>Creating a contextual lookup</h2>

    <p>First you must create a contextual lookup with the <a href=
    "fontinfo.html#Lookups">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Lookups
    dialog</a>, then in that same dialog create and name a subtable
    in that lookup. Then the contextual editor will open.</p>

    <h2>Editing a lookup</h2>

    <h3><img src="contextchain-format.png" width="476" height="503"
    align="right" />Format</h3>

    <p>Except for the reverse chaining features, any of these may
    come in one of three formats.</p>

    <p>The simplest format is a list of <a href=
    "#Glyphs">glyphs</a>. You may specify several glyph sequences
    in a single feature. So the script example above could be
    specified (quite inefficiently) by 4*26 lines like:<br />
    <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b a</code><br />
    <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b b</code><br />
    <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; o a</code><br />
    <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...</code></p>

    <p>The next format allows you to specify a list of <a href=
    "#Classes">classes</a>. In the script example we would define 2
    classes:<br />
    <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [bovw]</code><br />
    <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [ac-np-ux-z]</code><br />
    and define two patterns as:<br />
    <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; class1 [class2]<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; class1 [class1]</code></p>

    <p>The third format is the most general and allows you to
    specify your pattern by a <a href="#Coverage">separate list of
    glyphs</a> for each glyph position:<br />
    <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [bovw] [a-z]</code></p>

    <p>Most contextual specifications are fairly simple, FontForge
    has two dialog formats, one for simpler specifications and one
    for more complicated ones. The complicated dialog is (I think)
    more difficult to understand, but allows for greater
    generality.</p>

    <p>In both the glyph and the class format you are allowed to
    specify multiple matching rules (in the coverage format you may
    only specify one rule. I know this sounds odd, I did not design
    the system). <strong>UNFORTUNATELY</strong> the OpenType
    interpreters do not seem to support multiple rules within a
    single subtable. Instead I suggest you use multiple subtables.
    It will have the same effect but is less efficient. FontForge
    still supports multiple rules because the spec says it
    should.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h3><img src="contextchain-simplecoverage.png" width="659"
    height="503" align="right" /><a name="Coverage" id=
    "Coverage">Simple Coverage</a></h3>

    <p>This display shows a list of three items, the first column
    consists of coverage tables -- that is lists of glyphs. A match
    occurs if the current glyph matches one of the glyphs named in
    the current coverage table. The second column contains the name
    of a lookup that should be applied to the glyph associated with
    the coverage table if the entire rule matches.</p>

    <p>As noted earlier the rule is divided into three sections,
    backtrack, match and lookahead. The third column indicates when
    each section starts. Lookups may only occur in the middle (the
    "match") section. If you don't specify the start of each
    section FontForge will figure it out for you assuming that the
    match section starts with the first lookup and ends with the
    last. <strong>WARNING:</strong> this simple heuristic does not
    work for ligatures. The match section must be long enough to
    provide all glyphs that might be consumed by the ligature
    conversion.</p>

    <p>This lookup does not directly describe how transformations
    are to happen to the glyphs, merely WHEN. Instead it invokes a
    nested lookup that will be applied to specific positions in the
    match string (positions in the backtrack and lookahead lists
    may not be transformed).</p>

    <p>So in the example at right, the first list of glyphs is a
    coverage table in the backtrack section, while the second line
    starts the match section. The rule says that if one of the
    letters [bovw] is followed by any other letter, then the second
    letter should be transformed using the nested lookup
    "To-TopJoin" (which will convert the glyph into an alternate
    format). Here there is no need for a lookahead list (and there
    is none).</p>

    <h3>Setting a coverage table</h3>

    <p>You can change a coverage table by editing it. You may enter
    either glyph names or unicode characters (which will be
    converted to a glyph name -- a few characters which have
    special meaning: space, right parenthesis, asterix; must have
    their names typed in full). If you click on the little box on
    the right you will get a dialog containing a font view. In this
    view you may select glyphs to your heart's content, when you
    press OK these glyphs become your table.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h3><img src="contextchain-coverage.png" width="476" height=
    "503" align="right" /> Coverage</h3>

    <p>This display shows a list whose entries are coverage tables
    -- that is lists of glyphs. A match occurs if the current glyph
    matches one of the glyphs named in the current coverage
    table.</p>

    <p>In the example at right there is only a single coverage
    table here (but there could be more).</p>

    <p>In a Chaining Contextual feature it is also possible to
    specify a list of coverage tables to match glyphs before the
    current glyph, and another list to match glyphs after.</p>

    <p>In the example at right, the lookup 'high' will be applied
    to any glyph that matches the coverage table at the top of the
    list. Again the buttons under the sequence lookup list allow
    you to add, change, remove or reorder these transformations.
    (And yes, the order the transformations are applied can matter
    in complex situations).</p>

    <h4>Creating or editing a lookup position pair</h4>

    <p>You can change a lookup by clicking on it, this will produce
    a pull down menu of all lookups that can be applied. You can
    change the position by editing it.</p>

    <p>You can add a new entry by pressing the &lt;New&gt; button,
    and then selecting a lookup.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h3><img src="contextchain-simpleglyph.png" width="476" height=
    "503" align="right" /><a name="Glyphs" id="Glyphs">Simple
    Glyphs</a></h3>In the glyph format each rule allows you to
    specify a list of glyphs that need to be matched along with
    lookups that should be applied to appropriate glyphs after the
    match has been made.

    <p>Again each rule is divided into sections (here marked with
    the vertical bar "|"). In the match section glyphs may be
    followed by lookup names, and those lookups will be applied to
    the preceding glyph if a match occurs.</p>

    <p>So the example at right is an attempt to do with a series of
    glyph rules what was done easily with one coverage table rule.
    Every possible combination of letters must be spelled out as a
    separate rule.</p>

    <p>At the bottom of the list are two buttons, one to add a
    lookup reference after a glyph, and the other to start a new
    section.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h3><img src="contextchain-glyphlists.png" width="476" height=
    "498" align="right" /> Glyphs</h3>

    <p>This format allows you to specify several glyph lists to
    match. In the example at right the string "A,B,C" will be
    matched in the glyphs before the current glyph, then "D E"
    starting at the current location, and finally "F G H" after
    them. If everything matched then the lookup "Smallcaps" will be
    applied to location 0 (in this case "D") , and "superscript" to
    location 1 (here, "E").</p>

    <p>The order is significant, word processors will stop at the
    first match they find so in the following pattern
    strings:<br />
    <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b a</code><br />
    <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b a f</code><br />
    the second entry would never be matched because "b a" would be
    applied first. While:<br />
    <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b a f</code><br />
    <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b a</code><br />
    would apply match "b a f" when an "f" was present, and "b a"
    otherwise.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h3><img src="contextchain-pickglyph.png" width="476" height=
    "503" align="right" />Selecting glyphs</h3>

    <p>The text field may be manipulated as above. However here we
    are specifying a string of glyphs each of which must be
    matched, rather than a class of glyphs any of which could
    match. So in the example at right, "DE" would match, but "E"
    would not.</p>

    <p>As above a set of lookups can be applied after the match
    occurs.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h3><img src="contextchain-simpleclasses.png" width="476"
    height="503" align="right" /><a name="Classes" id=
    "Classes">Simple Classes</a></h3>

    <p>When specifying a class match, you must specify at least one
    set of glyph classes. If you only specify one set these classes
    will be used in all sections, alternately each section may have
    its own set of glyph classes. You may give each glyph class a
    name (if you don't then the class will be named something dull
    like "1", "2", etc.)</p>

    <p>You must also specify a list of patterns where each pattern
    is a list of class names (or numbers).</p>

    <p>Every set of classes has a magic class at index 0 which
    matches whatever glyphs are not explicitly mentioned in another
    class. FontForge displays this by calling it "{Everything
    Else}". You may not delete, edit nor reorder this class. Other
    classes are just unordered lists of glyph names (rather like
    coverage tables above), however any specific glyph may belong
    to at most one class at a time (whereas a glyph may occur in as
    many coverage tables as desired).</p>

    <p>In the example at right, any letter that occurs after one of
    the special letters [bovw] will be changed into an alternate
    form.</p>

    <p>There is a small bug here. Because classes must be disjoint,
    the "letters" class does not contain the letters [bovw]. So
    there actually needs to be a second rule that looks like
    <code>"high-after | high-after @&lt;To-TopJoin&gt; |"</code>.
    As I mentioned early, multiple rules don't actually work, so
    that rule is in a separate subtable (which is in the same
    lookup) and isn't displayed here.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h3><img src="contextchain-class.png" width="476" height="503"
    align="right" /> Classes</h3><br clear="all" />

    <h3><img src="contextchain-classlist.png" width="476" height=
    "503" align="right" />A list of Class numbers</h3>

    <p>Once you have set up your classes, you may then edit the
    patterns you want to match. To remind you of what your classes
    are, FontForge displays the class list underneath the pattern.
    Clicking on a class will insert that class's index into the
    pattern.</p>

    <p>Finally you must set the nested lookups. This is exactly the
    same as previous sequence / lookup settings.<br clear=
    "all" /></p>
