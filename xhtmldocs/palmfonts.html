    <h1>Palm fonts</h1>

    <p>Fonts on the palm pilot are rather limited. Each strike is
    stored in its own record of a database with no name or
    indication of whether it is connected to any other font (ie.
    there is no concept of a family of fonts. Each strike is
    alone).</p>

    <p>On old palm pilots the font data structure stored a strike
    for a single screen resolution. On newer pilots there is a
    different data structure which can store multiple strikes for
    several screen resolutions (called "density" on the palm).</p>

    <p>The new style font is unusable (causes crashes) on old
    palms. I am told that the old style font causes crashes on new
    systems.</p>

    <p>I'm told that at the moment new systems are all the same
    (high) density (so there is currently no need for a
    multi-density font -- what is needed is a single (high) density
    font in a multi-density wrapper).</p>

    <p>I am told that to be portable an application currently needs
    to supply an old style low-res font for old style palms, and a
    new-style font containing just a high-res strike.</p>

    <p>The palm OS reference documents the following densities:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>single</li>

      <li>one and a half</li>

      <li>double</li>

      <li>triple</li>

      <li>quadruple</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I'm told that only single and double are actually used.
    FontForge does not support the 1.5 density font.</p>

    <p>If you want to generate an old-style (low-res) palm font you
    should specify a single strike size in the Generate Font bitmap
    sizes field.</p>

    <p>If you specify two or more strike sizes in the bitmap sizes
    field then all sizes must be a small integer multiple (1,2,3,4)
    of the smallest strike. A dlg will come up asking whether you
    want these strikes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>All within a multi-density font</li>

      <li>All (except the smallest) within a multi-density font --
      FontForge calls this a high density font</li>

      <li>An old style low-res font containing the smallest strike
      in the first record of the database file and a new style
      multi density font containing all strikes within the second
      record of the generated file.</li>

      <li>An old style low-res font containing the smallest strike
      in the first record of the database file and a new style
      multi density font containing all strikes <em>except the
      smallest</em> within the second record of the generated
      file.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I believe the last format to be the most useful. This is the
    default, and is the format used for the script Generate
    command.</p>

    <p>Note: You must include the low-density strike. This strike
    defines the metrics for all the others. However you may
    generate a font which does not include this strike (the second
    choice in the list above).</p>
