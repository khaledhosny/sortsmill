    <h1 class="c2">Outline Glyph View</h1>

    <p><img src="charview2.png" width="544" height="656" /></p>

    <p>The outline glyph view is the window in which most editing
    happens.</p>

    <p>At the top of the window, underneath the menu bar is an
    information line. The first item is the location of the mouse
    pointer (in the internal coordinate system of the glyph). If
    there is a single selected point then the next item gives its
    location, and the next three are, respectively, the offsets
    from the selected point to the current location, the distance
    from the selected point, and the angle from the horizontal
    (measured counter-clockwise). Then we have the current scale
    factor, and the layer which is active. Finally (in the
    debugging view) is an indication of whether the instruction
    pointer is in the glyph program, the 'prep' program of the
    'fpgm'.</p>

    <p>Underneath the information is a ruler showing the current
    pointer location as a red line. There's a similar ruler on the
    left side.</p>

    <p>Underneath that is the glyph itself. On the left edge of the
    screen is a grey line indicating the x=0 line, further right is
    a black line showing where the glyph's width is currently set.
    There are also grey lines showing the ascent, descent and
    baseline.</p>

    <p>Background images and background splines are drawn in grey.
    Grid lines are also drawn in grey. Vertical hinting regions are
    drawn in light blue, Horizontal hints are drawn in light green.
    If any hints overlap the boundaries are drawn in cyan.</p>

    <p>The points of the glyph are of three types, corner points
    drawn as filled squares, curve points drawn as filled circles
    and tangent points drawn as filled triangles. If a point is
    selected then it will be drawn as an outlined square, circle or
    triangle and its control points are drawn as little magenta or
    dull-cyan xs at the end of a similarly colored line. (in a
    curved point the control points will be collinear). (the "Next"
    control point will be drawn dull cyan, and the Prev point will
    be magenta).</p>

    <p><img src="charview-quadratic.png" width="344" height="392"
    alt="A quadratic glyph" align="right" />In a TrueType font, an
    on-curve point can be implied between two control points.
    FontForge will draw these with an open circle.</p>

    <p>The initial point in a contour will be drawn in green, and
    beside it will be a tiny arrow pointing in the direction of the
    contour.</p>

    <p><img src="extrema-poi.png" width="204" height="274" alt=
    "Showing extrema" align="left" />Sometimes it is important to
    know which points are at the extrema of splines (postscript
    likes for there to be points at the extrema of all splines), if
    this is important to you set the "Mark Extrema" flag in the
    View menu. After that points at extrema will show up as dull
    purple. And internal extrema will also be marked.</p>

    <p>There are also two palettes, one, a layer palette, allowing
    you to control <a href="#Layers">which layers are visible</a>,
    and one, a tool palette, from which you <a href="#Tools">may
    pick editing tools</a>. Normally these are docked in the
    window, but you may choose to make them free floating windows
    by unchecking View-&gt;Show-&gt;Palettes-&gt;Dock Palettes.</p>

    <p>You select an editing tool by clicking on the appropriate
    button on the tools palette, or you may depress the right mouse
    button and select a tool from a popup menu (you may also change
    layers and do a few other things with this menu). There are
    four different tools bindings available to you (this may be a
    complication with no utility). The left mouse button has a tool
    bound to it, and this tool will be displayed when the program
    is idle. If you hold down the control key, another tool is
    available, by default this is a pointer but if you click on the
    tools palette with the control key down you can select
    something else. If you depress the middle mouse button you get
    a third tool (by default a magnifying glass), and the control
    key and middle button give you the fourth (a ruler).</p>

    <p>If the mouse pointer is close to a point (within a few
    pixels) when you depress the mouse, then the effective location
    of the press will be the location of the point.</p>

    <p>If you drag a glyph from the font view and drop it into a
    glyph view then FontForge will drop a reference to the dragged
    glyph into the view.</p>

    <p>Warning: <span class="c3"><strong>If your glyph has truetype
    instructions then editing it may cause those instructions to
    behave very oddly. If your glyph has anchor points which depend
    on truetype point matching then editing the glyph may
    disconnect the points. If your glyph is used as a reference in
    another glyph that positions references by point matching then
    editing this glyph may reposition those
    references.</strong></span></p>

    <h2><a name="Layers" id="Layers">Layers</a></h2>

    <p><img src="layers.png" width="123" height="84" align=
    "left" /> There are several drawing layers in the outline view.
    Each layer has an "eye box" (indicating whether it is visible
    or not), curve type ("C" for cubic, "Q"for quadratic, " " for
    Guide layer, which is always cubic), mode ("#" for Guide layer,
    "B" for background layers, "F" for foreground layers) and a
    name.</p>

    <p>The first layer is a set of guide lines/splines. These are
    common to all glyphs in the font. A few lines are provided for
    you (the x=0 line, the ascent, descent and baseline). Other
    handy lines might be the x-height of the font, the cap-height,
    ascender-height, descender-height, ... When you are working in
    any of the other layers, points will snap to splines in this
    layer (making it easy to force a consistent x-height for
    example).</p>

    <p>Next are the background layers, these contain background
    images and splines. These do not go into the font, but may be
    helpful to you in tracing the outline of your glyph. It is
    possible to paste an image into the background if you have an
    image manipulation program that supports selection by mime type
    (the kde family of applications does this, perhaps others),
    then FontForge will be able to read images in either
    "image/png" or "image/bmp", otherwise you may import background
    image files.</p>

    <p>When debugging truetype (<code><a href=
    "hintsmenu.html#Debug">Hints-&gt;Debug</a>)</code>, or showing
    gritfit outlines (<a href=
    "viewmenu.html#ShowGridFit"><code>View-&gt;Show
    Gridfit</code></a>) the visibility of the gridfit outlines can
    be controlled by the background layer's visibility.</p>

    <p>The last is the foreground layer, this contains the splines
    that actually make up the glyph that will be placed into the
    font.</p>

    <p>One can actually have multiple foreground and background
    layers. They can be created and deleted with "+" and "-"
    buttons. FontForge, won't delete last layer of its type,
    though. And care must be taken when generating a font to have
    the right foreground layer selected, if multiple are
    present.</p>

    <p>Layer curve type and visibility can be toggled freely with
    left mouse button. Making the layer cubic or quadratic is a
    little trickier, as it's done with right mouse button: a pop-up
    menu will appear, allowing for some additional operations, like
    moving contents between layers.</p>

    </map> There are 19 different editing tools, a mode button
    which alters the behavior of 5 of them, and two others
    (rectangle/ellipse and polygon/star) which come in two
    forms.</p>

    <p>At the bottom of the palette is a list of the current
    bindings of the mouse buttons. Here mouse button 1 is bound to
    the pointer tool, mouse button 1 with the control key pressed
    is also bound to pointer, mouse button 2 is bound to magnify,
    and mouse button 2 with control is bound to ruler.</p>

    <p>Many of the tools have different <a name="alt-meta-capslock"
    id="alt-meta-capslock">behaviors</a> if you hold the shift or
    alt (meta) key down when using the tool. On the mac there is no
    alt/meta key, and the Option and Command keys are usually bound
    to making a one button mouse look like a three button mouse. So
    on the mac fontforge uses the caps-lock key rather than
    alt/meta.</p>

    <h3><img src="cvarrowicon.png" align="middle" />The <a name=
    "pointer" id="pointer">pointer</a> tool</h3>

    <p>This tool is used for selecting points, images and
    referenced glyphs. It can also move these and scale images and
    referenced glyphs.</p>

    <p>Only things that are in the layer that is currently editable
    may be selected or moved or scaled.</p>

    <p>A simple click on an unselected point selects it and
    deselects everything else. A shift click on a point toggles
    whether that point is selected or not. A double click selects
    all points on the path containing that point. A tripple click
    selects everything in the layer. Clicking on the background
    will deselect everything. Clicking on the background and
    dragging out a rectangle will select everything within the
    rectangle. Clicking on a line or spline will select the two end
    points of that line or spline. Clicking on the dark part of an
    image (when in a layer with images) will select the image.
    Clicking on the outline of a referenced glyph will select that
    reference (if a reference glyph happens to have the same
    outline and bounding box, then holding down the <a href=
    "charview.html#alt-meta-capslock">meta/alt/caps-lock</a> key
    will allow you to move it once it is selected, without the meta
    key you will resize it).</p>

    <p>If a point has no visible control points, then they are at
    the same location as the point itself. If you want to select
    one of the control points then first select the point (to make
    the control points active) then hold down the meta key (use
    caps-lock on the mac) and depress the mouse on the point. This
    should allow you to drag one of the control points (if you get
    the wrong point the first time drag it out of the way, repeat
    the process to get the other control and then put the first one
    back). Sadly some window managers (gnome-sawtooth for one) will
    steal meta-clicks. If this happens you will need to use
    Element-&gt;Get Info to set the control points.</p>

    <p><img src="cpinfo.png" width="296" height="337" align=
    "right" />When you move a <a name="CpInfo" id="CpInfo">control
    point</a> you have the option (<code><a href=
    "viewmenu.html#CpInfo">View-&gt;Show Control Point
    Info</a></code>) of getting a popup box showing information
    about the control point (and its opposite number on the other
    side of the on-curve point). You will be told whether this is
    the next or previous control point, the absolute location of
    the point, the offset from the on-curve point, the slope
    expressed as a ratio, and as an angle, and the curvature on
    this side of the base point. At the very bottom is the
    difference between the two curvatures. Try to make this number
    approach 0 for curved points.</p>

    <p>Once something is selected you may drag it around. If you
    select something and drag the mouse then it and everything else
    selected will be moved. If you drag an open path and one of the
    end points happens to fall on the end point of another open
    path, then the two will be merged into one (If you don't want
    open paths to merge, hold down the <a href=
    "charview.html#alt-meta-capslock">Alt/meta/caps-lock</a> key).
    If you drag a control point then it will be moved (if you drag
    a control point defining an implied point, then the implied
    point(s) will also be moved).</p>

    <p>If you selected a spline, then dragging it will drag the
    location on the spline where you pressed the mouse (so you are
    changing the shape of the spline).</p>

    <p>If you hold the shift key down when you drag then the motion
    will be constrained to be either horizontal, vertical, or at a
    45° angle. (When moving control points the combination of shift
    and <a href="charview.html#alt-meta-capslock">meta (alt)</a>
    will mean that the control point is constrained to be the same
    angle from the base point as it was before you started moving
    it).</p>

    <p>If your font has an ItalicAngle set, and the ItalicConstrain
    preference item is set, then motion that would normally be
    constrained to the vertical is constrained to be along the
    ItalicAngle.</p>

    <p>If you move the mouse to the bounding box of a selected
    image or reference glyph and drag it then you will scale that
    object.</p>

    <p>If you move the mouse to the <a name="set-width" id=
    "set-width">advance width</a> line, then dragging it will
    change the width of the current glyph. If there are any bitmaps
    of this glyph then their widths will also be updated. If there
    are any other glyphs which depend on this glyph (ie. include
    this glyph as a reference) and their width was the same as the
    glyph's, then their widths will also be updated (so if you
    change the width of A, then the width of À, Á, Â, Ã, Ä and Å
    might also be changed). If you are displaying vertical metrics
    (in a font that has them), then you can use the same technique
    to modify the vertical advance.</p>

    <p>If you are in an accented glyph then you may not be able to
    change the width, as its width is bound to that of the base
    glyph (By setting the "Use My Metrics" bit in the reference
    containing the base glyph). This will be displayed as a lock
    icon at the top of the window near the width line.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to use the arrow keys to move selected
    items around. Each arrow will move the selection one em-unit
    (this can be changed in preferences to be any number of
    em-units) in the obvious direction. The selection may include
    the width (right bearing) line (or vertical with line). If the
    last thing you selected was a control point then that point
    will be moved. If you hold down the shift key at the same time
    the up and down arrows will move parallel to the italic angle
    (be careful of this: this leads to non-integral values). If you
    hold down the <a href="charview.html#alt-meta-capslock">meta
    (alt)</a> key, then the motion will be 10 times the normal
    amount.</p>

    <p>If you hold down the control key while working with the
    arrows then the view will be scrolled rather than moving the
    selection.</p>

    <p>If the glyph is a ligature (and has a ligature entry in
    Glyph Info) then it has the potential of having "ligature caret
    locations". Essentially this means that between each ligature
    component it is possible to place a caret location (so that the
    word processor will place be able to place a caret between each
    component of the ligature). In a ligature window a series of
    vertical lines will be drawn across the screen at the caret
    locations. By default these lines will be placed at the origin,
    but you may move one by placing the mouse pointer on it,
    depressing the button and dragging the line around. See the
    description on <a href="editexample4.html#ligature">building a
    ligature</a> for a more complete description.</p>

    <p>Clicking with the magnifying tool will magnify the view and
    center it around the point you clicked on. Holding down the
    <a href="charview.html#alt-meta-capslock">Alt/Meta/CapsLock</a>
    key and clicking will minify the view, again centered around
    the point at which you clicked. Again some window managers will
    steal meta-clicks, so you may have to use the View menu to
    minify (It's called Zoom Out</p>

    <p>If you drag out a rectangle with this tool then when you
    release, FontForge will shift and scale the view so that your
    rectangle just fits into the window.</p>

    <p>If your mouse has a scroll wheel then holding down the
    control key with the scroll wheel causes it to magnify or
    minify the window.</p>

    <h3><img src="cvhandicon.png" width="26" height="26" align=

    <p>You can use this tool to draw a random curve which FontForge
    will then attempt to convert into a set of splines. If you hold
    down the <a href=
    "charview.html#alt-meta-capslock">Alt/Meta/CapsLock</a> key
    then FontForge will close the curve when you release the
    mouse.</p>

    <p>If you double click on the icon in the tool palette you get
    a dialog similar to the <a href=
    "elementmenu.html#Expand">Element-&gt;Expand Stroke</a> which
    will give you slightly more control over the results, as you
    can have it not expand the stroke you draw (ie. leave a single

    "add-point">adding</a> curved, corner and tangent points.</h3>

    <p>These four tools behave similarly, differing only in what
    kind of point is added to the view.</p>

    <p>If a single point is selected, and if that point is at the
    end of a path then depressing the mouse button will create a
    new point where the mouse was depressed and draw a spline from
    the selected point to new point. If this new location happens
    to be the end of a path then the two paths will be joined (or
    if it is the end of the current path then the path will be
    closed).</p>

    <p>Otherwise if the mouse is depressed while being on a spline
    then a point will be added to that spline.</p>

    <p>Otherwise a new point is created not on any path at the
    location of the press.</p>

    <p>Once the point has been created then it becomes selected and
    all others are deselected. You may drag the point around, and
    if the point is on an open path and you drag it to the end
    point of another open path then the two paths will be
    joined.</p>

    <p>If you double click then a point will be added as above and
    a <a href="getinfo.html">Point Info</a> dlg will appear to give
    you fine control over the location of the point and its control
    points.</p>

    <p>The four different point types are</p>

    <ul>
      <li>curved points (where the incoming and outgoing splines
      have the same slope)</li>

      <li>horizontal/vertical curved points (similar to the above
      except the slope is constrained to be either horizontal or
      vertical)</li>

      <li>corner points (where the incoming and outgoing splines
      may have different slopes)</li>

      <li>tangent points (where one spline is a line segment and
      the other spline is curved then the curved spline is
      constrained to start with the same slope as the line).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><img src="cvpenicon.png" width="26" height="26" align=
    "middle" />The <a name="pen" id="pen">pen</a> tool</h3>

    <p>This tool behaves differently in cubic and quadratic
    editing. In many ways it is similar to the tools above as it
    adds a point to the current spline.</p>

    <p>In a cubic font the points created are curved points, and
    they are initially created with the control points on the point
    and as you drag you drag out the control points rather than
    moving the point itself around.</p>

    <p>In a quadratic font a point will be created half-way between
    the last control point and the current location (which becomes
    the next control point).</p>

    <p>If you hold down the Alt (Meta, etc) key you change the
    behavior so that cubic editing looks like quadratic and vice
    versa.</p>

    Tools for <a name="spiro-add-points" id=
    "spiro-add-points">adding</a> spiro control points</h3>

    <p>These tools add spiro control points to the current contour,
    these are only available in spiro mode, but the basic adding
    process is similar to the above.</p>

    <p>The different point types are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>G4 (continuous up to the fourth derivative)</li>

      <li>G2 (continuous up to the second derivative)<br />
      Basically, if you have a sharp curve you should probably use
      a G2 point, and if a more gentle curve a G4.</li>

      <li>corner</li>

      <li>prev constraint point -- vaguely like a tangent (Raph
      calls this a "left" point)<br />
      This type of point should be used where the contour changes
      from a curve to a straight line (where the curve is on the
      previous side of the constraint point)</li>

      <li>next constraint point -- vaguely like a tangent (Raph
      calls this a "right" point)<br />
      This type of point should be used where the contour changes
      from a straight line to a curve (where the curve is on the
      next side of the constraint point)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is based on <a href="http://www.levien.com/spiro/">Raph
    Levien's work</a> with clothoid splines which provide constant
    curvature across points.</p>

    <h3><img src="cvspiromodeicon.png" width="25" height="26"
    align="middle" /><a name="spiro-mode" id="spiro-mode">Spiro

    <p>This button toggles between editing contours using Bézier
    control points, or between using spiro (clothoid) control

    <h3><img src="cvknifeicon.png" width="26" height="26" align=
    "middle" />The <a name="knife" id="knife">knife</a> tool</h3>

    <p>This tool is used to cut splines. As you drag it across the
    view fontforge draws a line showing where the cut will happen.
    When you release, every spline you intersect will be cut-- that
    is at the location where this line intersects the spline two
    new points will be created and the old spline will be split in
    two connecting to the two new end points. These endpoints are
    not joined, so the spline is now open (or if it were previously
    open, it is now cut in two).</p>

    <h3><img src="cvrulericon.png" width="26" height="26" align=
    "middle" />The <a name="ruler" id="ruler">ruler</a> tool</h3>

    <p><img src="ruler.png" width="234" height="102" align=
    "right" />This tool tells you the current position of the
    mouse. If the mouse is near the outline it will give the slope
    and curvature there. If the mouse is near a point on the
    outline will give the slope and curvature on each side of the
    point.</p>

    <p>If you depress the button and drag, the first line of the
    tool's pop-up shows the distance, angle and (x-y) offsets from
    the first point where you depressed the mouse to the last
    point, the mouse's current location. The next lines in the
    pop-up show information about points along the line that
    intersect splines, including the start and end points of the
    line itself. If there are more than two intersections then the
    x, y, and total distance between the first and last
    intersections are shown before the point list.</p>

    <p>[0] indicates the starting point of the measure line, and
    the (x-y) co-ordinates of that point. Initially [1] is the end
    point; when it intersects with one spline then [1] becomes the
    first intersection point and [2] becomes the end point, and so
    on. The co-ordinates are followed by the x and y distances and
    then the final number is the length of the section ending at
    that point; which is also shown directly on the canvas.</p>

    <p>If you hold down the <a href=
    "charview.html#alt-meta-capslock">Meta/Alt/CapsLock</a> key
    then information will only be shown when the mouse is
    depressed.</p>

    <h3><img src="cvscaleicon.png" width="26" height="26" align=
    "middle" />The <a name="scale" id="scale">scale</a> tool</h3>

    <p>This tool allows you to scale the selection by eye rather
    than by a set amount (if there is no selection then everything
    in the current layer will be scaled). The location of the press
    will be the origin of the transformation, the further you move
    the point up and to the right the more it will be scaled in
    that dimension. If you want the scaling to be uniform or only
    in one dimension then hold down the shift key.</p>

    <p>Double clicking on this will bring up the transform dialog
    with the "Scale..." option selected.</p>

    <h3><img src="cvflipicon.png" width="26" height="26" align=
    "middle" />The <a name="flip" id="flip">flip</a> tool</h3>

    <p>This tool allows you to flip the selection either
    horizontally or vertically. Again the point at which you press
    the mouse is the origin of the transformation.</p>

    <p>Double clicking on this will bring up the transform dialog
    with the "Flip..." option selected.</p>

    <p class="c4"><strong>Note: After flipping an outline you will
    almost certainly want to apply <a href=

    <h3><img src="cvskewicon.png" width="26" height="26" align=

    <p>This tool allows you to skew the selection.</p>

    <h3><img src="cvrotate3dicon.png" width="26" height="26" align=
    "middle" />The <a name="rotate3d" id="rotate3d">rotate</a> 3D
    tool</h3>

    <p>This tool allows you to rotate the selection in the third
    dimension and project the result back onto the x-y plane. An
    imaginary line is drawn from the point where you pressed to the
    current point, this line determines the axis of rotation. The
    distance you move from the initial press determines the amount
    of rotation.</p>

    <p>Double clicking on this will bring up the transform dialog
    with the "Rotate 3D..." option selected.</p>

    <h3><img src="Eperspective.png" width="154" height="361" align=
    "right" /><img src="cvperspectiveicon.png" width="26" height=
    "26" align="middle" />The <a name="perspective" id=
    "perspective">perspective</a> tool</h3>

    <p>This tool allows you to apply a perspective transformation
    to the selection (this is a non-linear transformation). This
    tool uses three points: The glyph origin, the press point, and
    the current location of the cursor. In the image at right the
    mouse was pressed on the baseline near the glyph's advance
    width, and the mouse was released in the upper middle of the
    image. The glyph is transformed so that the release point is
    treated as the point at infinity. The line between the origin
    and the press point defines one axis of the transformation.
    Distances perpendicular to this line are retained, distances
    parallel to it are scaled as:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <i>x' = release_x + (release_y - y)/release_y * ( x -
      release_x )</i><br />
      <i>y' = y</i><br clear="all" />

    "rectangle">rectangle</a>/ellipse tools</h3>

    <p>By default this produces a rectangle, single-clicking on the
    tool palette will toggle between rectangle and ellipse, and
    double clicking in the tools palette gives you a dialog which
    allows you to control whether your rectangles are drawn with
    round corners, and how both rectangles and ellipses are
    specified.</p>

    <p>You can choose whether the rectangle (or ellipse) will be
    drawn between the point where you depressed the mouse on the
    view and the point where you released it (bounding box), or
    whether the point where you depress the mouse becomes the
    center of the rectangle and the point where you release it
    provides an end-point (center out).</p>

    <p>If you want even more control, you can double click in the
    glyph view and get another dialog which allows you to define
    numerically where the rectangle/ellipse should be placed, how
    big it should be, and whether it should be rotated.</p>

    <h3><img src="cvpolyicon.png" width="26" height="26" align=
    "middle" /> <img src="cvstaricon.png" width="26" height="26"
    align="middle" />The polygon/star tools</h3>

    <p>By default this draws a regular polygon, but by double
    clicking on the button in the tools palette you can make it
    draw a star, or select the number of verteces in your
    polygon.</p>

    <p>The polygon is drawn as though it were inscribed in the
    circle whose center is the point where you depressed the mouse
    and whose radius is the distance between the press point and
    the release point. One of the polygon's verteces will be at the
    release point.</p>

    <p>A star is drawn similarly. It will be a star generated from
    a regular polygon. As the number of verteces of the polygon
    gets larger the star will look more and more like a circle, for
    this reason the dialog box that allows you to pick the number
    of verteces will also allow you to pick how far the star's
    points should extend beyond the circle in which the polygon is
    inscribed (this will make a non-regular star, but it might look
    nicer).</p>

    <h2><a name="GridFit" id="GridFit">Grid Fit View</a></h2>

    <p><img src="GridFit.png" width="327" height="368" align=

    the results of rasterizing your glyph. If you have freetype's
    bytecode interpreter enabled you can also see how the truetype
    instructions in the glyph have moved the points around (if you
    don't have the bytecode interpreter enabled you will see what
    freetype's autohinter does to points). This mode can be invoked
    with <code><a href="viewmenu.html#ShowGridFit">View-&gt;Show
    Grid Fit</a></code>...</p>

    <p>The Show Grid Fit command will ask you for some basic
    information first. It needs to know the pointsize and
    resolution for which you want the action performed (the example
    at right is 12pt on a 72dpi screen).<br />

    <p>FontForge has a truetype debugger -- provided you have a
    version of freetype on your machine with the bytecode
    interpreter enabled <span class="c3"><strong>(Note: you need a
    license from Apple to enable this. It is protected by several
    patents)</strong></span>.</p>

    <p>The image to the right shows an example of this mode. You
    invoke it with <code><a href=
    "hintsmenu.html#Debug">Hints-&gt;Debug</a></code>, and as with
    the grid-fit view above you must establish a pointsize and and
    resolution. The view divides into two panes, the left of which
    is similar to the grid fit view above (except that it changes
    as you step through the instructions), the right pane provides
    a list of the instructions to be executed.</p>

    <p>In addition to showing you all the points in your glyph
    there are either 2 or 4 additional points. These are the
    so-called "phantom" points and represent the horizontal and
    vertical metrics of the glyph (old versions of freetype will
    only display 2 points -- left side bearing and advance width,
    while newer versions will display top side bearing and advance
    height as well).</p>

    <p>As you step through a glyph occasionally points will light
    up. This is FontForge's attempt to show you what points will be
    affected (usually moved) by the current instruction. Other
    points will have a circle drawn around them. These are used as
    reference points by the instruction.</p>

    <p>There are a series of buttons at the top of the instruction
    view. The first will single step the truetype program (step
    into), the second will step over procedure calls, the third
    will set a break point at the return point for the current
    function and continue until that is hit, and the fourth will
    continue until:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It hits a break point</li>

      <li>It hits a watch point</li>

      <li>It reaches the end of the glyph program</li>

      <li>An error occurs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The red "STOPPED" arrow shows the current location of the
    instruction pointer (and what instruction will be executed
    next).</p>

    <p>The fifth button allows you to set a watch point. You select
    a point (or several points) in the left hand pane, and press
    this button. Thereafter, whenever one of those points is moved
    FontForge will stop the glyph program. (You may also set watch
    points through the points window).</p>

    keys"</p>

    <p>Similarly you may watch storage and cvt locations by
    clicking on the appropriate spot in the storage and cvt
    windows.</p>

    <p>You can set a more conventional break point by clicking on
    an instruction. A little red stop sign will appear on top of
    the address area, and the program will halt when the
    instruction pointer reaches that instruction. Clicking on the
    instruction again will remove the breakpoint.</p>

    <p>Flaw: Currently there is no way to set breakpoints outside
    of the current function (or glyph).</p>

    <p>Flaw: Currently there is no way to examine the call
    stack.</p>

    <p>The sixth button brings up a menu with which you can control
    which of various debugging palettes are visible. The ones
    available so far are: Registers, Stack, Points, Storage, Cvt,
    Raster and Gloss.</p>

        <td>Shows the truetype stack. The value in parentheses is a
        26.6 number.</td>

        <td>
          Shows the points. You may choose to view the twilight
          points, or the points displayed in the glyph pane (the
          normal points). You may view the current location or the
          original location. You may view them in the units of the
          current grid, or in em-units.

          <p>When debugging a composite glyph the Transformed check
          box indicates whether the points of the current component
          have been transformed (to show where they fit in the
          composite) or not (showing where they are in the base
          component -- this is what the instructions are working
          on).</p>

          <p>The points may have some flags associated with them:
          'P' means the point is an on curve point, 'C' means the
          point is an off curve point (a control point), 'I' means
          the point is an on-curve point interpolated between two
          control points, 'F' means a phantom point, 'T' means a
          twilight point, 'H' means the horizontal touch flag has
          been set, 'V' means the vertical touch flag has been
          set.</p>

          <p>A small stop sign indicates the point is being watched
          (that is execution will stop if the point moves). You may
          change whether a point is watched by clicking on it.</p>

    <p>The final button will exit the debugger.</p>

    <p>The debugger also responds to some single character commands
    common to many debuggers:</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="2">
      <tr>
        <td>s</td>

        <td>step into</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>n</td>

        <td>step over (next)</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>c</td>

        <td>continue</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>r</td>

        <td>restart (with same grid)</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>f</td>

        <td>step out (finish routine)</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>k</td>

      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>q</td>

        <td>kill the debugger</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The Hints-&gt;Debug menu command can also be used to exit
    the debugger (by turning off the debug check box), or to
    restart the debugger with different values for the point size
    and resolution. This dlg can also control whether the fpgm and
    prep tables are debugged. Usually debugging will start when
    execution reaches the instructions associated with this
    glyph.</p>

    <h3>Debugging composite glyphs</h3>

    <p>FontForge is not as friendly when debugging composite glyphs
    as it should be -- this is influenced by the way truetype
    works. Suppose you want to debug the "Atilde" glyph.</p>

    <p>First FontForge will load and grid fit the "A" glyph, points
    from the "tilde" will not be displayed and behavior will be
    exactly the same as if you were debugging a stand alone
    "A".</p>

    <p>Then FontForge will load and grid fit the "tilde" glyph, and
    now points from the "A" glyph will not be visible. The point
    numbers on the "tilde" will be the same as they are in a
    stand-alone "tilde" (whereas in a true representation of
    "Atilde", the points numbering in the "tilde" component will be
    offset by the number of points in the "A" component). The
    "tilde" may appear oddly positioned, this is caused by
    rounding: the "tilde" will usually be translated, and this
    translation will usually be rounded to fit the pixel grid. The
    width line will show the width of the "tilde" and not of the
    "Atilde".</p>

    <p>Finally FontForge will execute any instructions in the
    composite itself, now all sub-components will be displayed, and
    all points will be numbered as they should be.</p>

    <p>Several words of caution:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If a component, or the composite as a whole, has no
      instructions then FontForge will not debug that piece (there
      will be nothing to debug).</li>

      <li>FontForge does not translate references which do point
      matching properly until the entire glyph has been
      loaded.</li>
    </ul>
