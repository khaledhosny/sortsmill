    <h1 class="c1">Math typesetting information</h1>

    <p>In summer of 2007 (as I write) MicroSoft is proposing an
    extension to OpenType which will allow fonts to contain
    information useful for mathematical typesetting. The
    information all lives in a new <code>'MATH'</code> table.
    FontForge now allows you to perform basic editing on this
    table.</p>

    <h2>Constants</h2>

    <p><img src="MATH-Constants.png" width="650" height="390"
    align="right" />The table is divided into several parts. One
    part provides information on font-wide constants (And I do not
    mean "pi" or 2.71828... when I say constant here). These have
    to do with the size of various elements of mathematical
    formulae with respect to one another, and the spacing between
    them. So <code>FractionNumeratorGapMin</code> specifies the
    minimum gap (white space) between the bottom of the numerator
    of a fraction and the fraction bar (the rule between the
    numerator and denominator.</p>

    <p>I will not describe all of these constants here, there are
    about 60 of them (and they take up 8 panes in the dialog). Most
    are fairly self-explanatory, but some I do not understand
    myself. FontForge has little popup messages plagerized from the
    specification which try to go into more detail.</p>

    <p>Some of these constants are stored as percentages of some
    other size (ScriptPercentScaleDown is and means that
    sub-elements should be drawn at a pointsize 73% of the current
    one -- I think). But most constants are represented in
    em-units, and most of these may also have device table
    adjustments specified. (At small pixel sizes (such as those
    used for screen fonts) the rounding error introduced by
    converting from em-units to pixels may be as large as the
    movement itself. A device table allows you to specify that (in
    the case of AxisHeight above) when the font is rasterized to be
    10 pixels high the Axis should be moved up by one pixel).</p>

    <p>FontForge is not always configured to support device tables,
    so if these columns are missing you just need to reconfigure
    and rebuild it.</p>

    <h2>Glyph specific information</h2>

    <p>In addition to the constants there are various bits of data
    that potentially pertain to each glyph.</p>

    <h3>Extended Shapes</h3>

    <p><img src="MATH-Exten.png" width="394" height="262" align=
    "right" />The simplest of these per-glyph data is a flag which
    indicates whether a glyph is an extended shape. Extended shapes
    tend to be taller than normal characters and need to have
    superscripts raised higher than normal shapes.</p>

    <p>This sub-table consists of a list of glyph names and an
    indication of whether this glyph is an extended shape (you may
    add additional glyphs at the bottom of the list, order is
    irrelevant here).<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h3><a name="Italic" id="Italic">Italic</a> Correction</h3>

    <p><img src="MATH-Italic.png" width="516" height="358" align=
    "right" />The concept of "Italic correction" will be familiar
    to users of TeX. Basically when an upright glyph is placed
    after an italic (or oblique) glyph the slanted glyph may
    overlap the upright one slightly (since it is designed to fit
    next to another slanted glyph). The italic correction is a
    small addition to the glyph's advance width applied when
    followed by an upright glyph (and in some other cases too).</p>

    <p>If you allow the mouse cursor to hover over an entry a small
    window will pop up showing the glyph, the normal advance width
    (as a dotted line), and the corrected advance width.</p>

    <p>Here again you are allowed to specify a device table to
    adjust the correction.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h3><a name="TopAccent" id="TopAccent">Top</a> Accent
    Attachment</h3>

    <p><img src="MATH-TopAccent.png" width="516" height="358"
    align="right" />When positioning an accent above a glyph
    Mathmatical typesetting follows complex rules to determine how
    high about the glyph it should go. The standard Mark To Base
    GPOS lookup is inappropriate here.</p>

    <p>Instead all that needs to be specified is the horizontal
    position at which the glyph and accent should attach.</p>

    <p>This table can be used to specify that position in both the
    base glyph and the accent. In the example at right I show one
    of each. The vertical line indicates the attachment position in
    each, and the glyphs will be adjusted so the two lines match
    up.</p>

    <p>Again a device table may be specified to control positioning
    at small pixel sizes.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h3><a name="MathKern" id="MathKern">Math</a> Kerning</h3>

    <p><img src="MATH-MathKern.png" width="380" height="302" align=
    "right" />This subtable is used when positioning subscripts and
    superscripts at various corners of a glyph. A glyph may have a
    superscript attached to either its top left or top right edge
    (limits for integral signs use the same mechanism, and probably
    other concepts will as well), and a subscript at the bottom
    left or right.</p>

    <p>In a slanted glyph it is clear that the horizontal
    positioning of a subscript should be different from the
    horizontal positioning of a superscript -- A problem similar to
    the italic correction. But this is more complex as the
    positioning point may depend on the size of the sub/superscript
    and exactly where it attaches vertically.</p>

    <p>This subtable allows you to specify a list of glyph
    kerning/height pairs for each corner of the glyph. Click on the
    word "Change" above to get a new dialog. These data may be
    specified textually:<br />
    <img src="MATH-MathKernText.png" width="519" height="431"
    align="left" /><br clear="right" />
    At any given height a kerning value may be specified. This
    value is relative to the default position of the subscript (and
    I'm not entirely sure what that is). As always device table
    adjustments may be specified.<br clear="all" />
    FontForge also allows you to specify these data
    graphically<br />
    <img src="MATH-MathKernGraph.png" width="743" height=
    "431" /><br />
    FontForge displays bottom right attachments relative to the
    advance width line of the glyph<br />
    FontForge displays top right attachments relative to the
    advance width plus the italic correction.<br />
    FontForge displays bottom left attachments relative to the
    origin of the glyph.<br />
    FontForge displays top left attachments relative to the italic
    correction.</p>

    <p>Note: If you are familiar with the MATH table spec you will
    recall that the last kern value does not have a height attached
    to it. FontForge tries to guess a reasonable value for the
    unspecified height (because it makes editing easier if I let
    the user move a point around), but have no fears, that guessed
    at value will never show up in the MATH table itself.</p>

    <h3>Vertical and Horizontal Glyph <a name="Variants" id=
    "Variants">Variants</a></h3>

    <p><img src="MATH-VertVariants.png" align="right" width="550"
    height="410" />Some glyphs, like parentheses and brackets need
    to be drawn in many sizes depending on the size of the formula
    they are enclosing. One possibility is just to draw them at a
    larger pointsize, but that is non-optimal because then the
    glyph will be symetrically scaled and so much bolder than it
    should be. Another solution is to design several variants of
    these glyphs at steadily increasing sizes. A third solution
    (which we will come to in the next section) is to design the
    glyph in sections so that it can be composed at any size.</p>

    <p>In this sub-table you may specify a normal sized glyph (here
    "leftparen") and then a list of variants in increasing
    sizes.</p>

    <p>Glyphs may be grow along either the vertical axis (as here)
    or the horizontal axis.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h3>Vertical and Horizontal <a name="GlyphConstruction" id=
    "GlyphConstruction">Glyph</a> Construction</h3>

    <p><img src="MATH-GlyphConstruction.png" width="594" height=
    "343" align="right" />As I said above, it is also possible to
    build a glyph out of bits of other glyphs.</p>

    <p>Each such constructed glyph has (potentially) and Italic
    Correction (and device table adjustment). This value should be
    independent of the size of the glyph.</p>

    <p>The components are rather difficult to specify in this
    display, but if you scroll the dialog to the far right you will
    find a little rectanglular box, and clicking on this will
    produce the dialog below.<br />
    <img src="MATH-GlyphConstructionDlg.png" width="322" height=
    "240" align="left" /><br clear="right" />
    Every <img src="MATH-GlyphConstructed.png" width="139" height=
    "583" align="right" />component is either an "Extender"
    component -- which means it may be stuck in the composed glyph
    as often as needed (or not at all) to make the glyph be as big
    as needed.</p>

    <p>Component glyphs may overlap one another. You may specify a
    maximum overlap for each end of each component. You may also
    specify how much the component adds to the total height (or
    width) of the composed glyph.</p>

    <p>Finally there is a font-wide constant (in the Connectors
    pane of the Constants section) called MinConnectorOverlap which
    specifies that glyphs must overlap by at least this
    amount.<br clear="all" />
    The per-glyph information may also be specified from the
    <a href="charinfo.html">Glyph Information dialog.</a></p>

    <p>I wish to thank Sergey Malkin at MicroSoft who provided me
    with a copy of the spec, and Apostolos Syropoulos who provided
    me with a test font containing a 'MATH' table.</p>
