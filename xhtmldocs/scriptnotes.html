    <h2><a name="Special" id="Special">Special</a> thoughts for
    special scripts</h2>

    <p><a href=
    "http://www.microsoft.com/typography/specs/default.htm">Microsoft</a>
    provides some information on what (opentype) features a word
    processor should support by default for certain scripts.</p>

    <p><span class="c2"><strong><big>Caveat:</big></strong></span>
    Just because a feature is documented and looks useful does not
    mean Uniscribe will use it for your script. Many Latin script
    fonts would like to use 'init', 'medi', 'calt', etc. but none
    of these features is turned on by Uniscribe for Latin.</p>

    <p><span class="c2"><strong><big>Caveat:</big></strong></span>
    Just because Uniscribe supports a feature that does not mean
    any given application will. Uniscribe (as of 2005) supports
    'liga' for latin, but neither Word nor Office does.</p>

    <p><span class="c2"><strong><big>Caveat:</big></strong></span>
    Uniscribe (MS unicode text layout routines) may ignore either
    the GPOS or the GSUB table depending on the script, and may
    even refuse to use the font at all if it doesn't have the right
    stuff in GPOS/GSUB. A Hebrew font must have both a GPOS and a
    GSUB. If it doesn't the font is not used. A latin font need not
    have either, but if it doesn't have GSUB then GPOS won't be
    used. So now if one table is present and the other isn't,
    FontForge will generate a dummy version of the other.</p>

    <h3>Common</h3>

    <p>Many characters are used in more than one script. The
    digits, marks of punctuation, etc. are said in Unicode to
    belong to the script "Common". OpenType does not recognize this
    script. The closest thing it has is the script 'DFLT'. My
    understanding is that characters in the common script will have
    the script of adjacent text assigned to them by OpenType.</p>

    <p>Thus if a font supports latin, greek or cyrillic then digits
    and punctuation might find themselves in any of those three
    scripts and all features which apply to any such character
    should be present in all scripts. For example if the digit 9
    kerns with digit 1, then that kerning data should be present in
    cyrillic and greek as well as latin.</p>

    <p>However it is possible (and I gather common in Japanese) to
    use the digits from one font surrounded by Kanji characters
    from another font. This means the digits may be in a font which
    does not support Kanji. However OpenType will assign them the
    Kanji script. Thus no lookups will be applied. Adobe suggests
    that for most features in scripts should also appear in the
    fallback script 'DFLT'. I'm not sure that anyone else follows
    this convention.</p>

    <h3>Latin</h3>

    <p>Uniscribe supports the <a href=
    "http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/standard/shaping.mspx">
    following features</a></p>

    <p>There are not many special complications in latin. Latin
    fonts can generally fit in a single byte encoding with no (or
    few) font tables. There are a plethora of accented glyphs which
    could be built -- or you could use mark to base positioning.
    Kerning should be generated for some glyph combinations. A few
    ligatures need to be generated (the "f" ligatures: ff, fi, fl,
    ffi, ffl and perhaps st -- however for some languages (Turkish)
    the "fi" ligature should not be built).</p>

    <p>You may want to add a set of smallcaps. Adobe has reserved a
    block in the private use area for latin small-caps -- this is
    now deprecated.</p>

    <p>Some languages have specific requirements of their own</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href=
      "http://studweb.euv-frankfurt-o.de/twardoch/f/en/typo/ogonek/kreska.html">
      For Polish</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Greek</h3>

    <p>Uniscribe supports the <a href=
    "http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/standard/shaping.mspx">
    following features</a></p>

    <p>Greek also does not have many complications. Modern Greek
    fonts generally fit in a single byte encoding. For modern greek
    are a few accented glyphs that need to be built, while for
    polytonic greek there are many -- mark to base &amp; mark to
    mark are options. Kerning should be generated. I am not aware
    of any standard ligatures for modern greek (ancient greek had
    ligatures and variants on some of the glyphs though).</p>

    <p>Small caps are again an option, and I have reserved a block
    in the private use area for them -- again this is
    deprecated.</p>

    <h3>Cyrillic</h3>

    <p>Uniscribe supports the <a href=
    "http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/standard/shaping.mspx">
    following features</a></p>

    <p>Cyrillic fonts also fit in a single byte encoding. There are
    a few accented glyphs. Kerning should be generated. I am not
    aware of any standard ligatures.</p>

    <p>Some languages need variant glyphs (specified with a 'loca'
    feature)</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href=
      "http://jankojs.tripod.com/SerbianCyr.htm">Serbian/Macedonian</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Arabic</h3>

    <p>Uniscribe supports the <a href=
    "http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/arabic/shaping.mspx">
    following features</a></p>

    <p>Arabic needs a complete set of initial, medial, final and
    isolated forms -- Unicode has reserved space for these. Arabic
    also needs a vast set of ligatures -- Unicode has reserved
    space for many, but I'd guess that extra ligatures will be
    needed sometimes. Arabic also needs a set of mark (mark to
    base, mark to ligature) attachments to position vowels above
    letters. Arabic may need a glyph decomposition table.</p>

    <p>I'm told that in good Arabic typography there need to be
    many more than 4 forms per glyph. I'm not sure how this should
    be supported.</p>

    <p>Right to left.</p>

    <h3>Hebrew</h3>

    <p>Uniscribe supports the <a href=
    "http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/hebrew/shaping.mspx">
    following features</a></p>

    <p>Hebrew has a few final forms but no special tables are
    needed for these. Hebrew may need kerning. Hebrew should have a
    set of mark (mark to base) tables to position vowels over
    letters. Hebrew may need a glyph decomposition table. I am not
    aware of any needed ligatures.</p>

    <p>Right to left</p>

    <h3>Indic scripts</h3>

    <p>Uniscribe supports the <a href=
    "http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otfntdev/indicot/shaping.aspx">
    following features</a></p>

    <p>Indic scripts need a set of ligatures.</p>

    <p>(they probably need a lot more but I'm not aware of
    what)</p>

    <h3>Korean Hangul</h3>

    <p>Uniscribe supports the <a href=
    "http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OpenType%20Dev/hangul/shaping.mspx">
    following features</a></p>

    <p>The Hangul script consists of a set of syllables built out
    of a phonetic alphabet. Generally fonts consist of a set of
    precomposed syllables.</p>

    <p>Complications are introduced by the massive combinatorial
    explosion of all these syllables. These are eased in postscript
    by CID-keyed fonts.</p>

    <p>Vertical writing and left to right writing are used, and
    some glyphs have a different orientation when drawn vertically
    (parentheses for example).</p>

    <h3>Japanese and Chinese (and Korean Hanja)</h3>

    <p>MicroSoft does not describe these scripts (that I can
    find).</p>

    <p>Again a massive collection of glyphs is needed, and
    postscript uses CID keyed fonts to deal with this.</p>

    <p>Vertical writing and left to right writing are used, and
    some glyphs have a different orientation when drawn vertically
    (parentheses for example).</p>
