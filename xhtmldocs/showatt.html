    <h1 class="c1">Show Advanced Typographic Features</h1>

    <p><img src="showatt.png" width="356" height="661" align=
    "right" />This dialog shows the contents of some advanced
    typography tables (GDEF, GPOS and GSUB for opentype fonts,
    kern, lcar, morx, opbd and prop for Apple fonts) as far as
    fontforge understands them. The dialog is hierarchical with the
    typical boxed +/- signs used for opening and closing
    sub-levels.</p>

    <p>The GSUB and GPOS tables are organized as one might expect.
    Underneath each table is a list of scripts, underneath each
    script is a list of languages, underneath each language is a
    list of features, underneath each feature is a list of glyphs,
    generally with some description of what happens (in the example
    a right the 'frac' feature turns 1/4 into Â¼). Some features are
    a little more complex (the 'kern' feature has a list of all
    glyphs that kern with the first glyph under the first
    glyph).</p>

    <p>The morx and kern tables are also broken up into scripts
    (Apple doesn't treat scripts at all, but it makes the state
    machines smaller, so fontforge uses the concept anyway), but
    languages are omitted (Apple tables will be based on data for
    the default language).</p>

    <p>Pressing the right mouse button will bring up a popup menu
    which will allow you to save the contents of the dlg (as utf8
    text).</p>
