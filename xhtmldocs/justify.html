  <p><img src="JustifyDlg.png" width="619" height="227" align=
  "right" />Text justification is handled differently in different
  scripts and in different languages within those scripts.</p>

  <p>In arabic special glyphs (called kashidas) are inserted into
  the text to fill up space, in latin interword spacing and even
  the within word letter spacing can be adjusted.</p>

  <p>But more sophisticated behaviors are possible. In some
  circumstances it might be appropriate to turn off ligatures,
  something which (in latin at least) will usually add a little
  more space to the line. In other cases a special kerning lookup
  might be invoked.</p>

  <p>OpenType allows a fairly general approach to this. Information
  is organized by script, and then by language within the
  script.</p>

  <p><img src="JustifyExtenderDlg.png" width="170" height="269"
  align="left" /><a name="glyphs-dlg" id="glyphs-dlg">The</a>
  extender list is specified at the script level. You may either
  enter a series of glyph names into the space provided in the
  dialog above, or click on the little box to the right and a
  dialog will pop up giving a more convenient entry mechanism.</p>

  <p>Several different priority levels may be specified within a
  language. The first priority level will be invoked to make small
  adjustments to spacing. If this is not enough to fix the problem
  then the second level will be invoked (in addition to the first,
  I believe). If the second level is not enough then third, fourth,
  fifth... levels will be invoked in turn until the line can be
  justified.<br clear="all" /></p>

  <p class="c1"><a name="language-dlg" id="language-dlg"><img src=
  "JustifyLangDlg.png" width="922" height="269" /></a></p>

  <p>Each priority level consists of two parts, a series of
  behaviors for when the line is too long (and needs to be make
  smaller) and another series for when the line is too short (and
  needs to be extended). Each of these, in turn consists of a set
  of lookups (in either GPOS or GSUB) to turn on, a set of lookups
  to turn off, and finally a special lookup which specifies the
  maximum amount the advance width of a glyph can change.</p>

  <p><img src="JustifyLookupDlg.png" width="316" height="227"
  align="right" /><a name="lookup-dlg" id="lookup-dlg">So</a> if
  you want to make a line shorter you might turn on ligatures and
  turn on kerning. Both of which (usually) make text shorter. On
  the other hand if you want to make a line longer you might want
  to turn those same lookups off.</p>

  <p>The maximum advance width lookups are a little different from
  normal lookups. These may be either single positioning GPOS-style
  lookups or kerning GPOS-style lookups. The lookup does not
  specify an exact adjustment to a glyph's width, rather it
  specifies the maximum (in absolute value) amount by which that
  glyph's width can change. So in latin typesetting you might have
  a lookup with information solely for the space glyph allowing it
  to (for instance) double in size when expansion is needed, or
  half in size when contraction is needed -- or any value between
  the normative amount and the adjusted maximum. At a higher
  priority level there might be a set of lookups which adjust the
  advance width of every glyph.</p>

  <p>In theory you could use a kerning lookup to specify the
  maximum width adjustment allowed between any two glyphs. (The
  OpenType spec actually says that <em>any</em> GPOS lookup could
  be used, except for contextual ones (which makes one wonder if
  contextual chaining lookups are permitted), no semantics are
  provided for these other lookup types and it is hard to imagine
  what they might do, so I'm ignoring them).</p>

  <p>These maximum lookups look like GPOS lookups, but are stored
  in the JSTF table. FontForge will display them in the GPOS lookup
  list but will output them the JSTF table when appropriate.</p>
