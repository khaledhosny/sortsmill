  <h1>Manipulating OpenType Lookups</h1>

  <p><img src="fontinfo-lookups.png" width="602" height="534"
  align="right" />You use the Lookups pane of the <a href=
  "fontinfo.html">Element-&gt;Font Info</a> command to control
  OpenType lookups.</p>

  <p>A lookup is a collection of commands that provide a text
  layout program with a transformation to apply on the input glyph
  stream. A lookup might specify how to form ligatures or how to do
  kerning, or any of a number of other things.</p>

  <p>Every lookup is composed of a number of subtables. Often this
  complexity is not needed and many lookups will contain just one
  subtable.</p>

  <p>Every lookup is named and every subtable is named. No two
  lookups may have the same name, nor may any two subtables.</p>

  <p>There are two major classes of lookups, those that reside in
  the GSUB table and substitute one glyph (or several) with another
  (ligatures) and those which live in the GPOS table and position
  one glyph relative to another (kerning).</p>

  <p>The order in which the lookups and subtables appear in this
  dialog is important. This is the same order in which they will be
  applied. All lookups in the GSUB table will be applied before any
  lookups in the GPOS table.</p>

  <p>There are buttons on the side for reordering the lookups. Up,
  Down, Top, Bottom should be obvious. You can also drag and drop
  lookups to reorder them. The [Sort] button will sort lookups
  depending on the cannonical order of the features attached to
  them. This will not always be the desired ordering, but it is a
  place to start.</p>

  <p>Lookups are applied in the order listed here. Which lookups
  will be applied depends on the script, language, and what
  features have been enabled (this will be controlled by the text
  layout engine, and perhaps ultimately by the user).</p>

  <p>Within a lookup, the subtables will be applied in order until
  one of them actually does something. Then no further subtables
  will be executed. Note that this is different from the way
  lookups behave -- all active lookups will always be applied, but
  only one subtable in a lookup will be.</p>

  <p>Suppose for example that you have a kerning class, and a few
  kerning pairs. If you put both of these into one lookup, with the
  kerning pairs in the first subtable and the kerning class in the
  second, then if a kerning pair matches the input stream the
  kerning class will not be applied (so you can have special cases
  that override the data in the kerning class).</p>

  <p>On the other hand if you put the pairs in one lookup, and the
  kerning class in another lookup, then both would be applied. And
  the resultant motion would be the sum of the two.</p>

  <p><img src="lookup-metadata.png" width="439" height="455" align=
  "left" />The <code>[<a name="Add-Lookup" id="Add-Lookup">Add
  Lookup</a>]</code> and <code>[Edit Metadata]</code> buttons will
  bring up a dialog that allows you to control the attributes of
  the lookup. Every lookup has a lookup type (here "Single
  Substitution") which specifies broadly what kinds of things this
  lookup can do.</p>

  </dl>

  <p>A lookup may be associated with one or more feature tags each
  of which may be active for various scripts and languages. You may
  edit the feature tag directly, or you may click on the little box
  and get a list of feature tags identified by their "friendly
  names" (so instead of 'smcp' you would see "Lowercase to Small
  Capitals").</p>

  <p>Similarly you may edit the script and language list directly,
  or you may press on the rectangle to get a friendlier dialog (see
  <a href="#scripts-dlg">below</a>).</p>

  <p>Every lookup is associated with a set of flags which control
  its behavior. The "Mark Class:" field is only active if there are
  <a href="fontinfo.html#MarkClass">Mark Classes</a> defined, and
  the "Mark Set:" field is active if there are <a href=
  "fontinfo.html#MarkSet">Mark Sets</a> defined. Mark classes and
  sets are very similar, with mark sets being the newer (largely
  unsupported as I write in spring 2009) but more versatile of the
  two. These provide an extension of the Ignore Marks flag -- if
  you specify a mark class (or set) then all marks will be ignored
  except those in the class (or set).</p>

  <p>Every lookup must be named. You may assign the name as you
  wish -- except that it must not be blank and must be unique. No
  two lookups may have the same name. (If you intend to use feature
  files, then lookup names should be: less than 31 characters,
  composed of ASCII alphanumerics, underscores and periods -- no
  spaces).</p>

  <p>For ligatures you have the option of specifying whether you
  want these ligatures output in an afm file.</p>

  <p><img src="lang-dlg.png" width="194" height="300" align=
  "right" /><img src="script-lang-dlg.png" width="439" height="217"
  align="left" />The <a name="scripts-dlg" id=
  "scripts-dlg">script</a> dialog allows you to enter scripts and
  languages. Again you may edit these directly or press on the
  little rectangles to get a list of friendly names. If you choose
  to bring up the language dialog you may choose more than one
  language in it (use the control key to make disjoint
  selections).<br clear="left" /></p>

  <p>After you have created a lookup you may add subtables to it.
  In most cases you will only need to create one subtable, but for
  contextual or kerning lookups you may need two or more (the
  second would contain a set of kerning classes, while the first
  would contain any special cases).</p>

  <p>The <code>[Add Subtable]</code> button will prompt you to name
  the new subtable, and will then bring up a dialog to allow you to
  edit the commands, the data, of that subtable. You may also bring
  up this dialog by selecting an existing subtable and double
  clicking on it (or by pressing the <code>[Edit Data]</code>
  button). The format of the dialog will depend on the lookup
  type.</p>

  <table cellpadding="2">
    <caption>
      <a name="basic-subs" id="basic-subs">Basic substitutions</a>
    </caption>

    <tr valign="top">
      <td>
        <p class="c2"><img src="subtable-gsub-single.png" width=
        "421" height="269" alt=
        "GSUB single glyph substitution" /><br />
        GSUB single glyph substitution dialog</p>
      </td>

      <td>
        <p class="c2"><img src="subtable-gsub-ligature.png" width=
        "421" height="237" /><br />
        GSUB ligature substitution dialog</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>Many of the basic substitution dialogs are very similar. Most
  of the dialog contains a list glyph names (one per line) on the
  left, and a list of substitution glyph names on the right. So in
  the example above left, the 'smcp' feature will map the glyph
  named "a" to the glyph named "a.sc", "b" to "b.sc" and so on. The
  multiple and alternate substitution dialogs allow a list of
  replacement glyph names on the right. In a multiple substitution
  the glyph will be replaced with all the glyphs named on the left,
  while in an alternate substitution the word processor will
  provide the user with a menu from which to pick a glyph. The
  ligature substitution is backwards in that the replacement glyph
  is the one on the left -- if the glyphs on the right appear
  together and in order then they will be replaced with the glyph
  on the left. So if an "f" is followed by an "f" then it will be
  replaced by an "ff" ligature glyph.</p>

  <p>The <code>[Populate]</code> button will fill the dialog with
  all glyphs in any of the scripts for which this dialog is active.
  If FontForge can figure out a default replacement glyph then it
  will in provide that as the default value (if it can't figure out
  a good replacement it will just leave the right side blank).</p>

  <p>The <code>[Add Selected]</code> button works in much the same
  way, but will only add glyphs selected in the font view.</p>

  <p>The <code>[Default Using Suffix:]</code> button will behave
  similarly (except it will only insert entries for which FontForge
  can find a replacement, and glyph name of that replacement will
  be found by appending the specified suffix to the glyph name of
  the base glyph).</p>

  <p>The <code>[Remove Empty]</code> button will remove any entries
  with no replacement glyph(s). The <code>[Delete]</code> button
  will delete the currently selected row.</p>

  <p>The various radio buttons and check boxes at the top of the
  dialog control how the base glyphs are ordered in the display --
  either in &lt;&gt;Alphabetic order (by glyph name) or in Unicode
  code point order. If [] By Base Char is checked then composed
  characters like "Egrave" will be ordered closer to "E" than to
  "Eth". If [] By Scripts is checked then glyphs of one script
  system will be grouped together no matter how they are ordered
  alphabetically or unicodally, thus "A" would be grouped with "B"
  and not with "Alpha".</p>

  <h3><a name="contextual-subs" id="contextual-subs">Contextual
  substitutions</a></h3>

  <p>The contextual substitution dialog is quite complicated and is
  discussed in its <a href="contextchain.html">own section</a>.
  These lookups can only live in an OpenType font, not in an Apple
  Advanced Typography font.</p>

  <h3><a name="sm-subs" id="sm-subs">Substitution by State
  Machine</a></h3>

  <p>The state machine substitution dialog is quite complicated and
  is discussed in its <a href="statemachine.html">own section</a>.
  These lookups can only live in an Apple Advanced Typography
  font.</p>

  <table cellpadding="2">
    <caption>
      <a name="Single-pos" id="Single-pos">Single Positioning</a>
    </caption>

    <tr>
      <td><img src="subtable-gpos-singlehide.png" width="415"
      height="280" /></td>

      <td><img src="subtable-gpos-singlefull.png" width="647"
      height="280" /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The single glyph positionioning lookup can potentially be
  quite complex, but generally in any specific case very little of
  that complexity is used and the dialog can be simplified. The
  lookup allows four different adjustments to each glyph:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The glyph may be moved left or right by a certain number of
    em-units</li>

    <li>The glyph may be moved up or down by a certain number of
    em-units</li>

    <li>The glyph's horizontal advance width may be altered by a
    certain number of em-units</li>

    <li>In fonts with vertical metrics a glyph's vertical advance
    may be altered by a certain number of em-units</li>
  </ol>

  <p>In addition to this you may provide pixel adjustments that
  apply to specific point sizes. At small pixel sizes (such as
  those used for screen fonts) the rounding error introduced by
  converting from em-units to pixels may be as large as the
  movement itself. In the example at right, if the 'subs' feature
  is applied to the glyph "a.sinf" that glyph should be moved
  downward by -560 em-units. Then if the pixel-size of the
  rasterization is 10 pixels, it should be moved down a further
  pixel, while if the pixel-size is 12 it should be moved up a
  pixel.</p>

  <p>The [] Hide Unused Columns check box will toggle between the
  two views above (well, not quite, I added two device table
  adjustments in the image on the right, so the adjustment column
  would remain after checking the checkbox).</p>

  <p>Often all the adjustments in a subtable will be the same (the
  ones here are) so the [*] Default new entries to first check box
  will give all new entries the same value as the first line.</p>

  <h3><a name="Pair" id="Pair">Pair</a> Positioning (kerning)</h3>

  <h4><img src="kerningformat.png" align="right" width="444"
  height="704" />Kerning format dialog</h4>

  <p>When you create a kerning subtable you will first be asked
  whether you want to create a kerning class subtable, or a kerning
  subtable with a list of glyph pairs.</p>

  <p>In either case, FontForge will ask if you want to it to
  automagically fill up the sub-table with guesses at appropriate
  kerning values. This is called "autokern"ing.</p>

  <p>In addition, FontForge can guess appropriate glyph classes for
  kerning by classes.</p>

  <p>If you aren't interested in autokerning and want to do
  everything by hand, most of this dialog is irrelevant, you are
  only interested in the two radio buttons at the top and the [OK]
  button at the bottom.</p>

  <p>But if you are interested in autokerning, you need to tell
  FontForge how closely it should kern glyphs, and what glyphs to
  kern. In addition if you want FontForge to pick kerning classes
  for you, you must specify the maximum allowable amount of
  cumuliative error between two glyphs before they must be in
  separate classes.</p>

  <p>The <code>Default Separation</code> and <code>Min Kern</code>
  fields are used in AutoKerning. The goal of kerning to to make
  the optical separation between all glyphs to be constant, and the
  <code>Default Separation</code> field specifies that desired
  value. The <code>Min Kern</code> value is simply to prevent the
  dialog from filling with useless junk. If AutoKerning suggests
  that two glyphs should be kerned by 1 em unit then this won't
  make any difference to the human eye and there is no point in
  including it. So if the kerning value (in absolute value)
  suggested by AutoKern is less than <code>Min Kern</code> then
  fontforge will ignore that value. Selecting <code>[]
  Touching</code> makes AutoKerning work in a slightly different
  way, instead of trying to make the optical distance be the
  desired value this attempts to make the minimum separation be the
  desired value (This is rarely useful, but occasionally people
  want to set text where the letters actually touch one another).
  The <code>[] Only kern glyphs closer</code> flag means that
  FontForge will only generate negative kerning offset, which will
  move glyphs closer together.</p>

  <p>Below these fields are two panes which look rather like
  fontviews. Here you may specify the selections you want to
  describe the glyphs being autokerned. There are two of these
  panes because you usually have a slightly different set of glyphs
  of interest on the left and right sides of a kerning pair. In
  English, a capital letter will rarely occur in the middle of a
  word, so you don't need it on the right side of a kerning pair.
  (Of course there are exceptions: "FontForge" uses an internal
  capital, but that is rare and if you want to save space in your
  font tables you can ignore it). Similarly the closing quote
  character will almost never be on the left side of a kerning
  pair.<br clear="all" /></p>

  <h4>Kerning pairs</h4>

  <p><img src="subtable-gpos-kernpair.png" width="523" height="537"
  align="right" /> The kerning class dialog is described in its
  <a href="metricsview.html#kernclass">own section</a>, while the
  kerning pair subtable dialog is described below.</p>

  <p>Each entry in the dialog specifies a pair of glyphs and then
  adjustments that may be made to each of those glyphs. Each glyph
  may be adjusted by any (or all) of the four adjustments mentioned
  above, so there are eight potential adjustments (and possibly
  device tables for each of those).</p>

  <p>In practice kerning tends to use only one of those 8
  adjustments. For left to right text this is generally the
  horizontal advance of the first glyph (x_adv#1), for right to
  left kerning the horizontal advance of the second glyph is used
  instead, and for vertical top to bottom text the vertical advance
  of the first glyph (y_adv#1). Again, the [] Hide Unused Columns
  may be used to simplify the dialog.</p>

  <p>Each time you enter a new combination, FontForge will try to
  guess a kerning offset for you (autokerning). So the
  <code>Separation</code> text fields have a similar meaning to
  that which they had above -- with the exception that the
  <code>Min Kern</code> and <code>Only kern closer</code> fields
  will be ignored for individual pairs.</p>

  <p>For more elaborate usage, <code>[AutoKern]</code> button will
  look at all combinations of glyphs in all scripts in the feature
  attached to this lookup. The <code>[AutoKern Selected]</code>
  button will look at all combinations of glyphs which are selected
  in the fontview (Neither of these will override existing
  combinations).</p>

  <p>Below the value matrix is a visual display of the currently
  selected kerning pair. You may adjust the kerning value by moving
  the second glyph around.</p>

  <p>You may select a pixel size at which to rasterize your glyphs.
  You may also request to see that rasterization magnified (Note:
  This is different from just rasterizing at twice the pixelsize,
  each pixel will be twice as big and the effects of rounding
  errors will be more obvious). Magnification is probably only
  useful if you are working on device tables for screen
  pixelsizes.<br clear="all" /></p>

  <h3><a name="Anchor" id="Anchor">Anchor Positioning</a></h3>

  <p><img src="subtable-gpos-anchor.png" width="421" height="239"
  align="left" />Marks (diacritical accents, vowel marks, etc.) may
  be attached to base glyphs using anchors. In the latin script,
  the grave, accute and circumflex accents might all attach to
  their base glyph at the same point, so these would all live in
  one anchor class. The dot below accent attaches at a different
  point and would need a different class.</p>

  <p>You may create as many anchor classes as you like. One mark
  may not be in multiple attachment classes, but a base glyph
  may.</p>

  <p>Anchor classes may also be used in cursive systems such as
  Urdu where the text slopes up the page. Each glyph has an entry
  point and an exit point, and the entry of a glyph will be
  attached to the exit of the preceding glyph.</p>

  <p>Marks may also be attached to marks. Vietnamese will often
  stack accents on top of one another.</p>

  <p>Finally, ligatures may have several attachment sites, one for
  each ligature component.</p>

  <p><img src="anchorcontrol-base.png" width="501" height="323"
  align="right" />The above dialog may be used to create a set of
  classes for each type of anchor subtable, then click on the
  <code><a href="anchorcontrol.html">[Anchor Control...]</a></code>
  button to view the marks anchored to bases glyphs.</p>

  <p>One glyph is selected (in this case a base) and its anchor
  point is displayed relative to it (the blue star in the first
  pane after the controls). Subsequent panes show all possible mark
  attachments.</p>

  <p>You may adjust the pixelsize of the display and the
  magnification factor (again the magnification factor is most
  useful if you are looking at small pixelsizes.</p>

  <p>You may provide device table adjustments for each
  pixelsize.<br clear="all" /></p>
