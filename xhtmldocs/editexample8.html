    <h2><a name="Opening" id="Opening">Opening</a> &amp; Importing
    Bitmap strikes</h2>

    <p>FontForge is primarily an outline font editor, but it does
    have some facility for editing bitmap (and greymap, or
    anti-aliased) fonts. A useful term here is a "strike"; a strike
    is one particular size of a bitmap font. When FontForge
    displays a font, that font will contain at most one outline but
    potentially many bitmap (or greymap) strikes (for several
    different pixel sizes).</p>

    <p>You might wonder if it is really necessary to provide
    bitmaps along with outlines given the high quality results of
    modern rasterizers, and for Latin (Greek, Cyrillic) fonts it
    may not be, but for CJK fonts at small pixel sizes a human eye
    can still make a better choice than even the best rasterizer.
    Back in the 1980s when Apple first adopted PostScript fonts
    they felt it was essential to have bitmaps to go with the
    outline -- so much so that it was not even possible to use a
    PostScript font without also providing at least one bitmap with
    it. Even today, when using a Type1 font on a mac there must be
    a bitmap font to point to it.</p>

    <p>Of course Type1 fonts are a bit old-fashioned now, but the
    sfnt file format (the format used for both OpenType and
    TrueType fonts) supports embedded bitmap strikes along with the
    outline version of the font. These strikes will be used in
    preference to rasterizing the outline in any pixel sizes for
    which they are present.</p>

    <p>If you have an sfnt with both an outline font and bitmap
    strikes you can open it directly with the <a href=
    "filemenu.html#Open">File-&gt;Open</a> command and FontForge
    will load all the bits and pieces.</p>

    <p>You can also open a bitmap only font directly with the
    <a href="filemenu.html#Open">File-&gt;Open</a> command, however
    if you have multiple strikes of the same underlying font in
    separate files, you will probably want to open only the first
    (or only the outline version) with Open, and use <a href=
    "filemenu.html#Import">File-&gt;Import</a> to merge the other
    strikes into one FontForge font.</p>

    <p>Suppose you have <code>Ambrosia.pfb</code> (an outline
    font), <code>Ambrosia-12.bdf</code>, and
    <code>Ambrosia-24.bdf</code> (two bitmap strikes, one 12 pixels
    high, one 24), and you want them all in one font. First use
    <a href="filemenu.html#Open">File-&gt;Open</a> to open
    Ambrosia.pfb, then <a href=
    "filemenu.html#Import">File-&gt;Import</a> and select both of
    the bitmap strikes (hold down the shift key).</p>

    <p>On the other hand, if you have only two bitmaps:
    <code>Ambrosia-12.bdf</code>, and <code>Ambrosia-24.bdf</code>,
    then use <a href="filemenu.html#Open">File-&gt;Open</a> to open
    either strike, and use <a href=
    "filemenu.html#Import">File-&gt;Import</a> and import the
    other.</p>

    <p>You may have noticed that Import has a checkbox labeled
    <code>[] As Background</code>. If you check this, then your
    bitmap font will not be loaded as a font itself, but will be
    loaded into the background of the outline font whence you can
    <code><a href=
    "elementmenu.html#AutoTrace">Element-&gt;Autotrace</a></code>
    it to provide an outline font from a bitmap. Be warned: This
    produces fairly bad results unless you have a large (100+
    pixel) font to trace.</p>

    <h2><a name="Creating" id="Creating">Creating</a> Bitmap
    strikes</h2>

    <p><img src="bitmapsavail.png" width="317" height="365" align=
    "right" />If you want to add a bitmap strike with a given pixel
    size to a font then use <code><a href=
    "elementmenu.html#Bitmaps">Element-&gt;Bitmap Strikes
    Available</a></code>. Simply add the pixel size you are
    interested in to the list at the bottom of the screen.</p>

    <p>If you are more comfortable dealing in point sizes, be aware
    that those depend on screen resolution. This dialog shows you
    the conversion between point and pixel sizes for two standard
    resolutions. The resolutions differ depending on what windowing
    system you use.</p>

    <p>You may add more than one pixel size, of course. You may
    also remove pixel sizes if you no longer want them.</p>

    <p>Normally when you create a new strike it will be rasterized
    from the outline font -- if there is no outline font then
    FontForge will attempt to scale the biggest strike available to
    the new size (in most cases this will be fairly ugly, but it
    may be better than nothing.</p>

    <p>There is also a checkbox <code>[*] Create Rasterized Strikes
    (Not empty ones)</code> at the bottom of the dialog. If you
    turn this off, then the rasterization process described above
    will not happen, and any new strikes will be created containing
    no glyphs (you can add glyphs later, of course).</p>

    <h2>Bitmap <a name="Properties" id=
    "Properties">Properties</a></h2>

    <p>In the old days of bdf and pcf fonts on X11 each font had a
    set of properties attached to it. It is not clear to me whether
    these properties are still useful as X11 moves to OpenType
    Bitmaps. They may be. At any rate FontForge will store them
    both in BDF fonts and in OpenType Bitmap fonts. Each strike may
    have its own set of properties. FontForge will generate them
    automatically when you create a strike (and will retain them
    when it reads in a font that has them). You may override the
    current values with the <a href=
    "elementmenu.html#BDF-Info"><code>Element-Bdf Info</code></a>
    dialog.</p>

    <h2>Creating a new bitmap <a name="bitmap-only" id=
    "bitmap-only">only</a> font</h2>

    <p>If you want to create a new font with no outlines, only
    bitmap strikes, you would use <a href=
    "filemenu.html#New">File-&gt;New</a> to create a new font, and
    then <code><a href=
    "elementmenu.html#Bitmaps">Element-&gt;Bitmap Strikes
    Available</a></code> to add some (empty) strikes to it. As soon
    as you add a strike to a new font, the font will become a
    bitmap only font.</p>

    <p>Apple has a bitmap only version of the sfnt file format, and
    X11 does too. Of course the two formats are slightly different.
    Windows has no support for a bitmap only sfnt format.</p>

    <h2>Bitmaps in the <a name="FontView" id="FontView">Font
    View</a></h2>

    <p>The <a href="viewmenu.html#bitmaps"><code>View</code></a>
    menu of the Font View (and the Metrics View) contains a list of
    all bitmap strikes in the font. You may select which one will
    be displayed in the Font View. You may also change the
    magnification at which a strike is displayed with <a href=
    "viewmenu.html#BitmapMag">View-&gt;Bitmap Magnification...</a>
    (it can be hard to see the details of an 8 pixel font on a high
    resolution screen, so you might want to display it at 3 times
    its actual size).</p>

    <p>Many commands in the Font View will apply to all strikes
    (and the outline) in the font. For instance <a href=
    "editmenu.html#Copy"><code>Edit-&gt;Copy</code></a> will copy
    the outline glyph and all bitmap glyphs. Sometimes you only
    want to affect one strike, if so then deselect <a href=
    "editmenu.html#Fonts"><code>Edit-&gt;Copy From-&gt;All
    Fonts</code></a>.</p>

    <p>The <a href=
    "elementmenu.html#Accented"><code>Element-&gt;Build</code></a>
    commands will build accented bitmap glyphs just as it builds
    accented outline glyphs.</p>

    <p>If the Font View is displaying a bitmap strike and you
    double click on a character, then FontForge will bring up a
    <a href="bitmapview.html">bitmap editing window</a> displaying
    that character in the current strike (rather than opening an
    outline editing window). If the character does not have a
    matching glyph in the current strike FontForge will create one
    by rasterizing the outline version of the font.</p>

    <h2><a name="Editing" id="Editing">Editing</a> Bitmaps</h2>

    <p><img src="BitmapView.png" width="254" height="273" align=
    "left" />The bitmap editing window should be fairly self
    explanatory. The window is a simple bitmap editor. With the
    pencil tool, clicking on a pixel will make it change. The line
    tool will draw a straight line between the start and end
    points.</p>

    <p>You can see the outline glyph in the background of the
    bitmap.</p>

    <p>You can regenerate the bitmap (by rasterizing the outline)
    by pressing the <code>[Recalculate Bitmaps]</code> button.</p>

    <p>Editing an anti-aliased greymap has the added complexity
    that you need to select a color (actually a level of greyness)
    to be applied with the pencil. There will be an additional
    palette with all possible greys for this.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><a name="Sparse" id="Sparse">Sparse</a> Bitmap Strikes</h2>

    <p>Sometimes you don't need a complete set of bitmap glyphs in
    a strike. Perhaps the rasterizer does a good job for all glyphs
    except one. Then you can create an empty strike (with
    <code><a href="elementmenu.html#Bitmaps">Element-&gt;Bitmap
    Strikes Available</a></code> unchecking the <code>[*] Create
    Rasterized Strikes</code> checkbox) and then select the one
    glyph you care about and say <a href=
    "elementmenu.html#Regenerate"><code>Element-&gt;Regenerate
    Bitmap Glyphs</code></a>.</p>

    <p>Alternately you could create a fully rasterized strike and
    then select the glyphs you don't need and say <code><a href=
    "elementmenu.html#RemoveBitmaps">Element-&gt;Remove Bitmap
    Glyphs</a></code>.</p>
