    <ul>
      <li>1-Mar-2004

        <ul>
          <li>The Check directions option of Find Problems caused
          multilayer mode to crash.</li>

          <li>Expand stroke would produce counter-clockwise paths
          when given an open contour and asked to fill it with a
          circular (or elliptical) pen</li>

          <li>Try to do a better job of guessing the correct
          direction of a path in an eps file (or a type3 or svg
          font)</li>

          <li>FontForge would crash when editing in the grid
          layer</li>

          <li>When the control key is down, make the scroll wheel
          do a magnify/minify.</li>

          <li>Various cosmetic changes to find problems

            <ol>
              <li>Specify that "nearness" is measured in
              em-units</li>

              <li>change "refs deeper than" to "refs nested deeper
              than"</li>

              <li>make check dir be on by default</li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>Put in more comments about fontforge. We now have a
          domain under <a href=
          "http://fontforge.sf.net/">fontforge</a>, future releases
          will be found there.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>29-Feb-2004

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge could crash if given a bad 'cmap'
          subtable</li>

          <li>Clean up generation of OS/2 a bit</li>

          <li>Pass motion events to windows even when a dlg is
          active (so that the mouse location will be shown in an
          outline window when the Point info dlg is active).</li>

          <li>Put in a comment about changing to FontForge in the
          copyright notice the program prints at start up.</li>

          <li>The "preflight" script on the mac had problems if the
          program had never been installed before</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>27-Feb-2004

        <ul>
          <li>Redid the way menus respond to arrow keys</li>

          <li>a multilayer enabled FontForge would crash when
          editing a normal font.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>24-Feb-2004

        <ul>
          <li>Remove the AddHint command and replace it with
          AddHHint and AddVHint.</li>

          <li>FontForge would crash when generating a mac family
          with NFNT bitmaps.</li>

          <li>Added support of exporting a character into PDF
          format.</li>

          <li>Oh dear, I was figuring out hintmasks in the wrong
          direction (because PS splines get reversed before output,
          so I now reverse them during the hintmask calculation
          too).</li>

          <li>At Werner's suggestion, added code to show what hints
          are currently active at a point.</li>

          <li>At Werner's suggestion added code to show what points
          are affected by a hintmask</li>

          <li>Added support for real editing of type3 (and svg)
          fonts. Support for editing stroked paths, different fill
          colors, multiple stroke/fill operations, etc. Because
          this involves a lot of extra overhead it is wrong for
          people who want to edit CJK fonts, so this mode is off by
          default. It may be turned on by

            <blockquote>
              <pre>
$ configure --with-multilayer
</pre>
            </blockquote>
          </li>

          <li>FontForge failed to interpret h/vstem3 commands
          properly when building a hintmask (when reading a type1
          font with hint substitution)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>11-Feb-2004

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge would crash when saving a non-multi master
          font.</li>

          <li>Adding new scripting commands ClearCharCounterMasks,
          SetCharCounterMask</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>10-Feb-2004

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge could produce bad tfm files.</li>

          <li>Added CheckForAnchorClass scripting command</li>

          <li>Added SetFontHasVerticalMetrics scripting
          command.</li>

          <li>FontForge would crash if asked to generate a
          contextual lookup which refered to a lookup which only
          was activated by a character(s) which was not worth
          outputting.</li>

          <li>FontForge did the wrong thing when evaluating the
          PostScript "index" command (it returned the wrong value
          from the stack (stack index off by one))</li>

          <li>Added support for the PostScript "for" loop.</li>

          <li>I have created a simple (1 axis) Multiple Master
          Type1 font with FontForge. It works with both ghostview
          and freetype.</li>

          <li>FontForge would crash when generating a ttf file from
          an sfd file which contain an invalid script/lang index.
          Put in code to warn user about this, and in some cases to
          correct it.</li>

          <li>FontForge had problems reading sfd files in the old
          point count format, this meant we still got bad point
          count errors.</li>

          <li>FontForge wrote bad sfd files if there were
          countermasks (all the contours of the glyph would be
          lost)</li>

          <li>I finally figured out why FontForge kept crashing
          when palettes were docked and an outline view was
          closed.</li>

          <li>Fixed various crashes in Interpolate fonts</li>

          <li>FontForge had problems with using subroutines to
          express references in PostScript (introduced 30-Jan)</li>

          <li>Added a new scripting commands AddHint and
          ReplaceCharCounterMasks.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>4-Feb-2004

        <ul>
          <li>Make it illegal to select both "Condense" and
          "Extend" in the mac style.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>3-Feb-2004

        <ul>
          <li>Point Info dlg crashed on the mac</li>

          <li>Add UI control over Mac Style through the Font Info
          dlg</li>

          <li>more prep work for mm fonts</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>2-Feb-2004

        <ul>
          <li>Generating a postscript font from a database with
          quadratic splines didn't work</li>

          <li>FontForge crashed on a font with two /CharStrings
          entries</li>

          <li>Small tweak to menubar behavior given left/right
          arrow (for Werner)</li>

          <li>Composite glyphs created with seac (type1) had the
          wrong transformation for the accent.</li>

          <li>more prep work for mm fonts</li>

          <li>Still have problems with ttf point counts</li>

          <li>If a user loaded a ttf file and made it monospace and
          then generated it as ttf, all glyphs except the .notdef
          had an advance width of 0</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>1-Feb-2004

        <ul>
          <li>sfd reader had a bug. Went into an infinite loop if a
          hintmask contained any of the characters [a-fA-F].</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>31-Jan-2004

        <ul>
          <li>In Type2 output, when putting a glyph into a
          subroutine, if that glyph had no conflicts but had a
          hintmask fontforge produced a bad font (which crashed
          FontForge when it tried to read it in).</li>

          <li>configure script still wasn't working on solaris (or
          mac with libiconv probably)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>30-Jan-2004

        <ul>
          <li>The kerning state machine addition broke the indic
          state machine dialog</li>

          <li>The mac docs claim that the 'feat' table should be
          sorted by feature id. But if you do this WorldText can't
          find features. All Apple fonts seem to be sorted by the
          order the features are used in the 'morx' table's chains.
          WorldText works if you do this.</li>

          <li>Yannis proposed several extensions to the State
          Machine editor, most notably the ability to move the edit
          dialog with Up/Down/Left/Right buttons.</li>

          <li>I had the feature settings for Linguistic
          Rearrangement and Vertical Subs. reversed.</li>

          <li>In some cases I wasn't outputting anything to turn a
          feature off.</li>

          <li>Fixed many problems with kerning state machine
          dlg</li>

          <li>Fixed several problems with insertion state
          machines</li>

          <li>Fixed several problems with reading in state
          machines.</li>

          <li>Added SetMacStyle() to give the user control over how
          mac families are built.</li>

          <li>Added a fflush after doing Print()s in scripting</li>

          <li>FontForge would crash when given an extremely long
          real number in a cff dictionary (in this case the font
          itself was in error)</li>

          <li>FontForge did not copy a bitmap character's width
          when it copied the bitmap.</li>

          <li>Char Info didn't handle pairwise positioning
          properly.</li>

          <li>Some more pangrams from <a href=
          "http://shair.net/misc/txt/pangram.en">http://shair.net/misc/txt/pangram.en</a>
          (link provided by David Shaal)</li>

          <li>My old approach to hint substitution caused problems
          with multiple master fonts. So now I keep track of which
          points are substitution points and what the hint masks
          are at those points. There is a new command which will
          automatically figure out these points, and the user may
          control them directly through Point Info (Element-&gt;Get
          Info). At the same time I figured I might as well do the
          same thing for counter masks, so FontForge will read
          counter masks in from otf file (I did not implement this
          for type1s), there is a new command to try and make a
          guess as to what they should be, and the user may control
          them directly through Element-&gt;Char Info. (new
          scripting commands, SubstitutionPoints() and
          AutoCounter() do the obvious).</li>

          <li>Added a Hints-&gt;Don't AutoHint command to mark a
          character as having hints the user likes which should not
          be modified until the user explicitly calls AutoHint().
          (and a matching scripting command).</li>

          <li>Added ability to control whether a PostScript font
          (type1&amp;type2) is output with rounding.</li>

          <li>FontForge could generate a bad 'post' table for
          bitmap only fonts.</li>

          <li>FontForge didn't allow you to create two pairwise
          positioning items with the same tag.</li>

          <li>Hungarian names for mac features and for some
          standard names like "Bold", etc. provided by Laszlo
          Karoly.</li>

          <li>Pierre HANSER noticed that if FontForge mapped a
          single glyph to two encodings then bitmap generation
          through freetype got confused.</li>

          <li>If a font contained a non-.notdef character at
          encoding 0, then generating an opentype font from it had
          a fair chance of crashing.</li>

          <li>Added a couple of new select menu items:
          Select-&gt;Contours, Select-&gt;First Point, Next
          Contour</li>

          <li>Added a new sub-menu to allow ordering contours
          within a glyph. This is almost totally useless (the final
          look of the character should not be affected by the order
          in which the contours are drawn), but for multiple master
          fonts, the contour list must have the same ordering in
          corresponding glyphs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>11-Jan-2004

        <ul>
          <li>A patch for reading broken mac tables got lost. I've
          reinstated it.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>10-Jan-2004

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge would crash when asked to use the truetype
          debugger on fpgm</li>

          <li>FontForge always coloured the background of debugger
          windows grey.</li>

          <li>The Points window did not show any points.</li>

          <li>Changed the Points window and the character view to
          show whether a point has a watch point set on it.</li>

          <li>Display the code range ('fpgm'/'prep'/Glyph) in the
          character's info line when debugging.</li>

          <li>When creating a 'fpgm'/'prep' table we created one
          with some garbage instructions in it.</li>

          <li>Somehow I neglected to put in a dlg for editing the
          'cvt ' table. This has been rectified.</li>

          <li>There was a bug in the postscript interpreter (the
          thing used for reading .eps files and type3 fonts) and
          transforming a point by a matrix with diagonal entries
          (rotation, skew, etc.) gave the wrong value.</li>

          <li>Added code to preserve more of the PS graphic state
          when eps file does a gsave</li>

          <li>Merge Fonts would crash when merging a font with
          references into an empty font</li>

          <li>I wasn't providing default values for width/weight
          classes in the OS/2 table</li>

          <li>The bitmap dlg could write one byte beyond the area
          allocated in some cases.</li>

          <li>Changed the outline character popup menu to include
          an Add Anchor Point entry</li>

          <li>The Ligature index wasn't correctly enabled in some
          cases.</li>

          <li>Add little arrows near the first point of each
          contour (in the outline character view) showing the
          direction of the contour.</li>

          <li>The mac's interpretation of the CFF spec is very
          picky, but correct. If a font contained no references
          then FontForge would generate an empty subroutine index.
          This is wrong. There should be no subroutine index,
          rather than an empty one. (Strangely, global subroutines
          have the reverse requirement. Stupid). Now if there are
          no references, then FontForge will not generate a local
          subroutine index.</li>

          <li>Yannis Haralambous has corrected the French UI.</li>

          <li>Three new scripting commands: AddAnchorClass,
          AddAnchorPoint, RemoveAnchorClass</li>

          <li>Show ATT did not show glyph classes properly.</li>

          <li>Made scripting dlg be resizable.</li>

          <li>Save As &amp; Import dlgs looked bad in French.
          Various other improvements to make things look better on
          non-english systems.</li>

          <li>Added the ability to set the glyph class from Char
          Info.</li>

          <li>FontsInFile did not work on pfb files (nor on
          cff)</li>

          <li>Opening a mac resource file with multiple FONDs from
          a script would crash.</li>

          <li>In Font Info-&gt;TTF Names the languages now appear
          in unicode ordering no matter what the locale (used to be
          the langs were in alphabetical ordering for English, even
          if they were actually French)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>2-Jan-2004

        <ul>
          <li>More accurate round joints in stroking.</li>

          <li>Better approximations to splines which turn through
          180 degrees or more</li>

          <li>Support for reading cff files.</li>

          <li>Yet more problems counting ttf points</li>

          <li>Update copyright notices.</li>

          <li>Add code to protect FontForge against reading bad
          Apple lookup tables (I think the Zapfino.dfont that ships
          with 10.3 has two bad lookups, but perhaps I just don't
          understand them).</li>

          <li>Try harder to avoid using 'DFLT' script when coming
          up with a default script for glyphs with no innate
          script.</li>

          <li>Add a Find Problems to detect 'DFLT'</li>

          <li>I've been generating bad Simple Positioning subtables
          for GPOS all along.</li>

          <li>Be pickier about what glyph names I let the user
          choose.</li>

          <li>On cygwin (perhaps elsewhere, but I was never able to
          find the bug elsewhere) if you invoked one command from
          the menu while another was still executing, then
          fontforge would probably crash.</li>

          <li>Support for reading and writing bare cff files.</li>

          <li>Build Accents crashed when asked to build accented
          chars for iacute, etc. in a font without dotlessi.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>28-Dec-2003

        <ul>
          <li>RemoveATT scripting command didn't work if the third
          argument were "*"</li>

          <li>FontForge's clipping in the character view left
          something to be desired.</li>

          <li>Make Meta-Arrow move selected points by 10 times what
          Arrow would move them by.</li>

          <li>Grabbed the feature ordering for GPOS/GSUB specified
          on the <a href=
          "http://www.microsoft.com/typography/specs/default.htm">microsoft
          site</a> and taught it to FontForge.</li>

          <li>Change the Point Info dlg

            <ul>
              <li>to allow the user to control the point type from
              there.</li>

              <li>to enforce constraints on control points (ie. the
              control points of a curve point must be in line with
              the point itself)</li>

              <li>by adding an alternated mode of entering data, by
              distance and angle (rather than just offset)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Some MF fonts have glyph names with characters which
          aren't allowed in PostScript names</li>

          <li>FontForge failed to set widthset when it read in
          glyphs from a windows FNT (FON) file. This meant that
          some glyphs might be ignored.</li>

          <li>The context chaining dialog had a bad test for valid
          glyph names and complained about any name containing
          digits</li>

          <li>The histogram dlg would crash if the mouse moved
          across it when the window was so wide that it could
          contain more stem widths than were actually in use.</li>

          <li>Added three commands to the metrics view view menu to
          allow users to insert glyphs by name or encoding.</li>

          <li>Yannis points out that afm files produced on fonts
          with vertical metrics did not contain "WY" values
          (vertical advance width), also that the vkerns in the
          file actually contained the values of horizontal
          kerns.</li>

          <li>The 'kern' table did not contain pairwise vertical
          kerns (it did contain vertical kerning by class).</li>

          <li>The View-&gt;Substitutions sub menu of the
          metricsview was not being cleared properly if the current
          glyph had no substitutions.</li>

          <li>Yannis wants the View-&gt;Substitutions menu to have
          a way to return to the original glyph.</li>

          <li>Yannis points out that the metricsview in vertical
          mode changed the top side bearing in an unexpected way.
          Also the vertical advance width did not refresh the
          display properly.</li>

          <li>Thanks to David Opstad, I now have an example of a
          format 1 kerning table and have extended FontForge to
          support kerning by state machine.</li>

          <li>The code for generating and loading otb (OpenType
          bitmap) fonts was broken.</li>

          <li>And the code for generating my own weird bitmap only
          fonts for windows had some flaws too (different
          flaws).</li>

          <li>If I typed a character into a fontview (or char view)
          and the font did not contain the character, fontforge
          would not select that slot that encoded the character,
          even if the character was in the encoding.</li>

          <li>When loading a ps type3 font, make sure that the
          glyph name is available when parsing glyphs so we can
          produce reasonable error msgs. (mostly this means "Spline
          stroke is too big"</li>

          <li>Only generate Spline stroke too big errors once per
          font.</li>

          <li>Adam Goode tells me that the format 12 (32bit
          unicode) cmap was wrong, and provided a patch to fix
          it.</li>

          <li>Pretty much rewrote the stroking command from
          scratch.</li>

          <li>Merge fonts would crash when merging in a font
          containing either a ligature caret or a nested
          lookup.</li>

          <li>Made FontForge cognizant of the proposed unicode
          dotlessj character (0237), it will now use either this or
          the dotlessj in adobe's private use area (depending on
          which is in the font)</li>

          <li>FontForge would crash when trying to build an
          accented character based on inverted breve in pala.ttf

            <ul>
              <li>It wrongly considered pala.ttf to be slightly
              italic (.0005°)</li>

              <li>It would crash when doing this in an italic
              font</li>
            </ul>
            <hr />
          </li>

          <li>When importing postscript (type3 fonts, eps files)
          counter-clockwise paths which are both stroked and filled
          cause problems</li>

          <li>Changed the version stamp of otb fonts from 'OTTO' to
          1.0</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>10-Dec-2003

        <ul>
          <li>When there were multiple features with the same tag
          (different scripts with 'kern' for instance) FontForge
          would produce multiple copies of the same lookup instead
          of different lookups.</li>

          <li>FontForge was not setting the right to left lookup
          flag bit properly for hebrew (and presumably arabic)
          kerning</li>

          <li>Remove overlap was coalescing some splines that it
          should not have.</li>

          <li>Typo in expand stroke meant that some round line
          joins were really weird</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>5-Dec-2003

        <ul>
          <li>When changing the ascent/descent with fontinfo or
          scaletoem some of the OS/2 fields did not get updated
          properly.</li>

          <li>The OS/2 TypoDescent field was set positive instead
          of negative.</li>

          <li>Added two scripting functions SetTTFName and
          GetTTFName to give scripts access to the truetype names
          as well as the PS ones</li>

          <li>Patch from Kazuyuki. SetPanose didn't work when
          argument was an array.</li>

          <li>New French translations from Pierre</li>

          <li>$copyright didn't return the correct thing (Patch
          from Giuseppe Ghibo)</li>

          <li>Kerning pair data for non-ASCII unicode characters
          did not get output properly into SVG fonts</li>

          <li>The AddATT scripting command did not add ligatures
          correctly leading to problems when time came to generate
          a font.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>23-Nov-2003

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge would crash if given an encoding for the
          locale which it didn't understand</li>

          <li>Center/Thirds in width from the font view would
          change the width</li>

          <li>There was a synchronization problem and the truetype
          debugger window could deadlock</li>

          <li>FontForge failed to read a Contextual (but not
          Contextual chaining) Coverage lookup properly.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>10-Nov-2003

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge was crashing when loading a bitmap font
          with encoded characters outside the range specified by
          the encoding (ie. a character 0x10000 in a unicode BMP
          font).</li>

          <li>Fixes for several memory leaks provided by Kazuki
          Ohta</li>

          <li>Slight improvements to the
          View-&gt;Combinations-&gt;Ligature dlg</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>8-Nov-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Bug introduced 6-Nov, FontForge generated a bad
          'loca' table when outputting a ttf outline font with
          bitmaps.</li>

          <li>FontForge was getting the truetype point number wrong
          when reading outlines from an sfd file.</li>

          <li>If the loca table was 2 or 4 bytes long, FontForge
          failed to warn about a bad glyph count.</li>

          <li>FontForge got confused if two truetype glyphs had the
          same name.</li>

          <li>When dumping out embedded ttf bitmaps, FontForge got
          confused by the extra glyphs (.null and return) and
          generated garbage.</li>

          <li>Make View-&gt;Combinations-&gt;ligature dlg a bit
          better for non-latin glyphs</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>6-Nov-2003

        <ul>
          <li>The clut used for drawing anti-alias bitmaps in the
          metrics view was wrong.</li>

          <li>In a bitmap only ttf file, FontForge was usually
          producing bad line spacing data as far as the mac was
          concerned.</li>

          <li>When importing bitmaps into an empty font, we might
          as well change to font view to show the bitmaps rather
          than the empty outline data.</li>

          <li>If glyph 0 was selected in the fontview then the
          File-&gt;Open Outline command was disabled.</li>

          <li>With a user defined encoding we were again getting
          occasional crashes. (introduced by my work on
          bitmaps)</li>

          <li>On certain glyphs, the optimizer introduced an slight
          error when calculating a spline's coefficients from its
          control point. Even though this error was on the order of
          7e-8 it was enough that the rasterizer produced grossly
          incorrect results. I have pulled the relevant routine out
          into its own file which is now compiled by itself without
          optimization.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>4-Nov-2003

        <ul>
          <li>When FontForge removes glyphs with Font
          Info-&gt;Encoding-&gt;Number of characters, it will now
          run through the font and remove any ligatures,
          substitutions, etc. refering to non-existent glyph
          names.</li>

          <li>Some improvements to remove overlap.</li>

          <li>Added a warning message so that when user attempts to
          output a ttf file where no characters have unicode
          encodings, then the user at least gets warned that the
          result will probably not work. For fonts with fewer than
          256 glyphs it will offer the choice of a symbol
          encoding.</li>

          <li>If a reference were copied in the outline character
          view and pasted into the font view, fontforge would
          crash.</li>

          <li>the expand stroke patch on 29-Sept broke calligraphic
          and ellipse modes.</li>

          <li>The mouse's scroll wheel did not work in the metrics
          view.</li>

          <li>The metrics view resized very slowly under window
          managers which do continuous resizing.</li>

          <li>Give the magnifying glass's rectangle mode a
          threshold so that it doesn't resize tiny rectangles which
          are really caused by mouse jitter.</li>

          <li>Attempt to set a zoom size for character and bitmap
          windows, but modern window managers don't seem to support
          the old protocol, and I can't find docs on a new
          version.</li>

          <li>Was not converting filenames to unicode properly for
          the open/generate progress dlgs.</li>

          <li>FontForge would crash when attempting to draw a
          character for which in had no (X11) glyph when doing
          bidirectional text.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>29-Oct-2003

        <ul>
          <li>When removing an ATT feature from a glyph using a
          script, FontForge would screw up memory. Leading to
          unpredictable results.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>28-Oct-2003

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge would crash when converting from cubic to
          quadratic splines in a script</li>

          <li>FontForge would leave a dangling pointer when
          converting from cubic to quadratic. This did not affect
          ttf generation, but would affect most other
          operations.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>27-Oct-2003

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge would crash when changing the encoding of a
          font with a .notdef character to a user defined
          encoding.</li>

          <li>If one had multiple ligatures for the same glyph with
          the same tag and script, FontForge would eat all but one
          of them.</li>

          <li>When generating most kinds of font, of a font which
          had ligatures containing glyph names that were not in the
          font, then FontForge would often screw up memory and
          eventually crash.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>26-Oct-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Simplify sometimes removed points at extrema even
          when it should not have</li>

          <li>If one had a ttf font (with instructions) and merged
          in a postscript font and then generated a ttf font,
          FontForge would complain about an internal error, but go
          on to produce a valid font. It should no longer
          complain.</li>

          <li>When generating fonts from a script, if the font were
          in compacted format the generated font would have a
          compact encoding (instead of the desired encoding).</li>

          <li>Kanou provided a patch to speed up importing bitmap
          fonts.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>23-Oct-2003

        <ul>
          <li>The change on the 20th to make custom encoding
          support 32bit unicode was incomplete and made custom
          encodings crash instead.</li>

          <li>The File-&gt;Display dialog ignored the
          left-sidebearing of a glyph causing output of some fonts
          to look awful.</li>

          <li>Was getting the AdobeStandardEncoding a bit wrong
          (after the 5-Oct change to the new unicode glyph list
          which does not contain "fi" nor "fl")</li>

          <li>I used to set the "widthset" bit on .notdef
          characters, but there's really no point to that.</li>

          <li>Maxim Iorsh tells me that U+fb4f should be a historic
          ligature.</li>

          <li>On some displays right scrolling the Histogram dlg
          would leave black lines on the window.</li>

          <li>AutoHint removed too many stems from consideration as
          hints on some very bold fonts</li>

          <li>Make FontBBox of Type1 fonts be executable. Adobe
          says it doesn't have to be, but dvips expects it to
          be.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>20-Oct-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Windows XP &amp; 2000 insist on having (what cygwin
          describes as) the execute bit of the file set. So
          FontForge now sets execute permissions on ttf, otf and
          pfb fonts on the cygwin platform.</li>

          <li>If a menu was so big that it had to be positioned
          over the menubar (instead of above or below it), and the
          user clicked on the menubar to invoke it, then the mouse
          release would go to the new menu and invoke whatever item
          happened to be under the cursor. Not good.</li>

          <li>Oops. The Effects sub-menu should have been disabled
          for quadratic (truetype) fonts.</li>

          <li>Added a new configuration option --with-regular-link
          to disable my dlopening of libraries. I dislike this. I
          don't think it is anywhere near as flexible as the dlopen
          method. It makes it much harder to ship something that
          will work with freetype (detecting whether the bytecode
          interpreter is present must be done at link time rather
          than run time and that is a severe disadvantage. But I
          have been asked for it.</li>

          <li>Change internal format so that custom encodings can
          handle 32 bit unicode.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>16-Oct-2003

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge was still outputting a disordered name
          table.</li>

          <li>The source tarball on the website included many files
          twice and some files that it should not have included at
          all. I should now be less than half the size it used to
          be.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>15-Oct-2003

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge did not bother to open files in binary
          mode. If cygwin was configured with DOS linebreaks, then
          fontforge failed to generate valid font files on cygwin.
            <hr />
          </li>

          <li>Added some more warnings to the default build list
          and fixed the problems they indicated.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>12-Oct-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Several bad bugs in last night's build (name table
          was (usually) all screwed up, conversion from PS to TTF
          got incorrect Internal Error msgs)</li>

          <li>Order tables in truetype output
            <hr />
          </li>

          <li>My 5-Oct-2003 libpng fix broke it completely. Should
          now be refixed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>11-Oct-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Another patch from Kanou to recognize encodings
          better in bdf files.</li>

          <li>Various memory fixes found by valgrind</li>

          <li>The Element-&gt;Find Problems-&gt;ATT-&gt;Missing
          glyph names fixup dlg had some formatting problems and
          failed to skip properly.</li>

          <li>Draw an "x" through encodings which do not map to
          glyphs</li>

          <li>If the user is in a compacted encoding and asks to
          print a font, then revert to the uncompacted encoding for
          the duration of the printing.</li>

          <li>View-&gt;Show ATT would show ligatures (and
          substitutions) even if some of the glyphs in the glyph
          list were missing.</li>

          <li>Fix a number of bugs found by the MS Font Validator

            <ul>
              <li>I misunderstood (and the spec incorrectly
              documented) the behavior of the maxp table</li>

              <li>I had a typo in figuring out the OS/2 table</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>I had one more case where I was computing the point
          count of a glyph incorrectly.</li>

          <li>Make the width line snap to zero when the user drags
          near it.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>6-Oct-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Give the Metrics View a vertical mode in which it
          does vertical kerning, etc.</li>

          <li>Add a hack to allow FontForge to parse a weird pfb
          file.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>6-Oct-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a number of bugs in the new kerning class dlg
          including:

            <ul>
              <li>Vertical kerning classes were displayed
              horizontally</li>

              <li>When adding a new class the new offsets were
              garbage</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>The routine to convert a horizontal kerning class to
          the equivalent vertical kerning class (of the vertical
          variants of the glyphs in the horizontal class) didn't
          work.</li>

          <li>In Back and Lookup Classes of a contextual chaining
          substitution by class, the [New] button was never
          enabled. (it was disabled if []SameAs was on, and then
          never enabled).</li>

          <li>My new 94x94 encodings were actually 93x93. Patch by
          kanou.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>5-Oct-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Got rid of GreekFixup and added Interpretations of
          encodings to FontInfo</li>

          <li>FontForge failed to output ligature substitutions
          nested under a context/chain sub</li>

          <li>If a font had more than about 5 nested ligatures,
          fontforge would screw up its memory and (likely)
          crash</li>

          <li>Fixed various problems pertaining to adding a kerning
          class to an empty font</li>

          <li>Add a runtime check for the case where the user's
          system has a dynamic libpng installed without libz</li>

          <li>If a character had ligature carets then FontForge
          could crash when determining its script</li>

          <li>FontForge was reading mac 'kern' format 3
          incorrectly.</li>

          <li>Rewrote the Kerning class creation dialog. I hope it
          is clearer now.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>2-Oct-2003

        <ul>
          <li>got rid of my strange 94x94 encodings for JIS/KSC/GB
          (based on the kuten array) and used instead the much more
          obvious encoding that everyone else uses.</li>

          <li>BDF files were output with the wrong encoding name
          for JISX0208 (I was outputting "JISX208" instead--
          missing a "0").</li>

          <li>Autotrace failed to read potrace output properly if
          there were more than one contour in a given glyph.</li>

          <li>Upgraded psunicodenames to the current Adobe Glyph
          List for New Fonts.</li>

          <li>Simplify now works for quadratic splines. If one uses
          the []Allow Slopes to Change checkbox then results are
          not good. I need a better algorithm.</li>

          <li>If asked to generate a type0 postscript font for a
          font encoded with an extended 1byte encoding (ie. one
          that had about 300 characters) FontForge would probably
          crash.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>29-Sept-2003

        <ul>
          <li>When a path was both stroked and filled (in a
          postscript/eps file), fontforge would ignore the
          stroke.</li>

          <li>I forgot that the stroke linewidth needs to be
          transformed by the current transformation matrix. This
          meant that when a path should have been stroked by an
          ellipse (when reading a ps/eps file) fontforge would
          blithely stroke it with a circle.</li>

          <li>Added some support for reading the /Metrics
          array.</li>

          <li>If there were a sharp corner (where the "radius of
          curvature" of the corner was less than the radius of the
          pen used to stroke the path) then FontForge would
          generate an incorrect path.</li>

          <li>Round line joins were not a good approximation to
          circular arcs.</li>

          <li>When filling the outline character view, rounding
          errors caused the fill bitmap to stray from the
          outline.</li>

          <li>Extend the functionality of the magnifying (or
          minifying) tool so that if the user drags out a rectangle
          with it then the view will be shifted and scaled so that
          rectangle fits in the window.</li>

          <li>FontForge will no longer auto-generate hints on
          non-integral boundaries. In Type1 fonts such hints become
          meaningless and just confuse things.</li>

          <li>FontForge will now draw a halo around points which
          will be part of a flex hint. See the <a href=
          "prefs.html#UpdateFlex">UpdateFlex</a> preference
          item.</li>

          <li>FontForge now has as set of commands for manipulating
          typographic features in large lumps rather than one at a
          time.

            <ul>
              <li>Copy features from one font to another</li>

              <li>Remove certain features</li>

              <li>Give features a new tag</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>I have greatly rewritten the code for dealing with
          AAT fonts

            <ul>
              <li>FontForge now supports mac feature/setting values
              to be used as feature tags as well as opentype 4
              letter tags</li>

              <li>FontForge will now read any feature in even if it
              doesn't map to an opentype tag</li>

              <li>FontForge understands the most of the state
              machines in the morx/mort tables (it does not
              understand ligature state machines, it parses these
              for all unconditional ligatures, but it will miss any
              conditional ones).</li>

              <li>FontForge now lets you edit apple state
              machines</li>

              <li>FontForge lets you specify feature/setting names
              in the font to override the default values specified
              in preferences</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Added support for reading Apple's format 3 kern
          sub-table format (another way of storing a kerning
          class)</li>

          <li>Oops. SVG didn't read relative movetos properly in a
          path option. Patch by Kengo Ichiki.</li>

          <li>Simplify had a bug when passed a path which consisted
          of a single point with a zero length spline connecting it
          to itself</li>

          <li>Simplify was not greyed out properly in quadratic
          fonts</li>

          <li>Some of the low-level error routines consumed massive
          amounts of cpu time while waiting for events</li>

          <li>The PostScript parsing routines would sometimes think
          that "noaccess" was part of the value of something in the
          private dictionary.</li>

          <li>Several other patches to importing images by
          templates from scripts. By Kengo Ichiki</li>

          <li>Importing pcf bitmaps into the background had some
          problems.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>4-Sept-2003

        <ul>
          <li>the 17-Aug addition of context/chaining broke anchor
          classes. Should be fixed now.</li>

          <li>Károly László has added Hungarian translations for
          the style codes to Font Info-&gt;TTF Names</li>

          <li>If a font had comments, an svg file generated from it
          had syntax errors.</li>

          <li>Add support for generating multilingual strings (in
          'name') for the apple platform.</li>

          <li>Add support for the packed gb2312 which mac and
          windows seem to use.</li>

          <li>Make a UniqueID of -1 in Font Info mean that the font
          has no UniqueID.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>31-Aug-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Add problems for maximum number of hints (96) and
          maximum number of subroutine nests (references) ~10.</li>

          <li>I looked at AppleChancery again and figured out why I
          was having trouble parsing its 'mort' ligature tables,
          and put in code to make it easy to parse tables of this
          type.</li>

          <li>After figuring that out, I realized there was a bug
          in my own table generation. Suppose we have two ligatures
          "f l =&gt; fl" and "s t =&gt; st", and are given "fst".
          Then my table would fail to find the "st" ligature. The
          state of 'read "f" waiting for "l"' would see that it
          didn't get an "l" and revert back to the initial state.
          It should instead have checked to see if "s" could start
          a ligature in its own right, and if so jump to the 'got
          "s" waiting for "t"' state.</li>

          <li>The same fix needs to be done for contextual glyph
          substitution.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>29-Aug-2003

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge failed to display the morx table if all it
          contained were simple substitutions.</li>

          <li>FontForge generated incorrect simple substitution
          (AAT) tables if it found a substitution with no valid
          elements</li>

          <li>New problem for find problems. Check for characters
          with more than 1500 points in them.</li>

          <li>FontForge will now draw selected points in a
          different color (currently yellow), and draws them
          bolder. This makes them stand out better for Find
          Problems (but also makes it harder to distinguish between
          corner and curved points).</li>

          <li>Redid the way FontForge handled arabic forms in AAT.
          Old method was cleaner but depended on behavior which is
          unspecified in Apple's docs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

          <li><span class="c1"><strong><big>The preference dlg has

          <li>FontForge wasn't always getting the script/lang right

          dlg.</li>

          <li>The newly generated apple state machines for
          context/chaining were quite wrong. I hope I've got them
          right now.</li>

          <li>The []PSNames checkbox (in Generate Font, Options
          dlg) did the opposite of what it was documented to do.
          Behavior has been changed to conform to the documentation

          <li>FontForge would crash when loading some sfd files

      <li>26-Aug-2003

        <ul>
          <li>When I added metadata to svg fonts (20-Aug) I
          inadvertently put in two closing metadata tags. Which
          broke the font.</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug conversion of context/chain coverage
          sub-table into a morx subtable.</li>

          <li>Figured out in what cases I could generate a morx
          subtable from context/chain glyph or class format
          subtables.</li>

          <li>Fixed problems reading required features from ttf

          <li>Updated French UI</li>

      <li>25-Aug-2003

        <ul>
          <li>View-&gt;Show ATT didn't show contextual/chaining
          tables even if they would be put in the 'morx' table</li>

          <li>View-&gt;Show ATT had problems showing anything in
          'morx'</li>

          <li>Make it possible to edit contextual/chaining lookups
          that are formatted by class</li>

          <li>parsing/generating ttf files with class format
          context/chaining had problems</li>

          <li>loading a class format context/chaining lookup caused

          <li>Added a conversion routine from glyph to class format
          context/chain</li>

          <li>Kanou points out that not all encodings available in
          Font Info-&gt;Encoding are present in the scripting

          <li><span class="c1"><strong><big>FontForge did not
          interpret SVG relative paths properly, and did not
          generate correct SVG output because of

          assuming things should be interpreted as in the Type1
          rrcurveto operator (where each point is relative to the
          previous point in the operator) rather than the rcurveto
          operator (where each point is relative to the initial
          point).</li>

          <li>If FontForge opened a Bold font stored in OTF CFF

          <li>Added a "BBox" item to CharInfo scripting.</li>

          <li>Added a FontsInFile scripting command to return an

          <li>Change so that when opening a file containing
          multiple fonts the font's filename contains the fontname
          (so it is possible to open other fonts from the same

          <li>Add the ability to generate fonts which contain both
          OpenType and Apple Advanced Typography tables (ie. a font
          that should work everywhere).</li>

          <li>Added Utf8(int), Chr(int), Ord(int) to interconvert

          <li>Various improvements to the goto dialog from James
          Crippen.</li>

          <li>If the ttf "Apple" box got checked then it remained
          checked in subsequent Generate Fonts even though the
          [Options] dialog did not show it checked.</li>

          <li>FontForge would crash if given an Anchor class with
          no marks.</li>

          <li>Hmm... I notice that volt only uses format 2 coverage
          tables. I wonder if windows fails to handle format 1
          tables...</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>30-Jul-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Add support for <a href=
          "http://www.w3c.org/TR/SVG11/fonts.html">svg fonts</a>
          (and add dependency on libxml2 for reading them in)</li>

          <li>Add support for importing/exporting svg files (again
          libxml2 needed for import)</li>

          <li>Add support for required features.</li>

          <li>In quadratic fonts the ellipse tool did not draw
          ellipses</li>

          <li>Add support for rectangles/ellipses drawn center out
          rather than just within the bounding box</li>

          <li>Preserve the rect/ellipse tool settings across
          invocations</li>

          <li>Put a license entry into the help menu</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>20-Jul-2003

        <ul>
          <li>made the default linux browser be mozilla rather than
          netscape.</li>

          <li>If the metrics view were displaying an anchored pair
          (mark-base), and a character were typed into the text
          field at top before the anchored pair, then the display
          got very strange.</li>

          <li>FontForge got confused when merging a font which
          contained multiple encodings for the same glyph</li>

          <li>FontForge got confused if there were an lparen in a
          directory name (thought this meant a font
          collection).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>15-Jul-2003

        <ul>
          <li>We weren't parsing any type3 fonts properly any
          more</li>

          <li>Extend our ps interpreter to understand some of
          METAPOST's idioms better.</li>

          <li>I used to call all characters which weren't in the
          encoding ".notdef" this could cause problems if a user
          forgot to name them. I now give them unique names
          starting with "NameMe". I still leave characters &lt;256
          called ".notdef" if the encoding calls for it, this may
          be a mistake...</li>

          <li>Fix on 14-July to simplify was incomplete.</li>

          <li>More fiddling with autohint</li>

          <li>Added support for the new X11 opentype bitmap
          format.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>14-Jul-2003 (Bastille Day!)

        <ul>
          <li>There are still cases where I'm getting the truetype
          point count wrong. If a truetype file had a control point
          that lay under an end point, then I would treat that as a
          "no control point" mark, and ignore the cp. But if I do
          that blindly I mess up the point count, so during font
          generation I must be prepared to put the cp back.</li>

          <li>Kanou provided a patch to fix a bug in the underlying
          graphics library.</li>

          <li>Add a popup menu to Show Att to allow those data to
          be saved (as utf8 text)</li>

          <li>Fixed (I hope) right to left kerning</li>

          <li>Added 'ccmp' entries by default for Hebrew</li>

          <li>Fixed a couple of bugs with the new simplify more
          options</li>

          <li>fontforge didn't compile on solaris. It now
          does.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>12-Jul-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Remove weirdness in scripting interface to TeX font
          parameters</li>

          <li>Kanou points out that the code for reading format 4
          embedded (ttf) bitmaps was ambiguous and would behave
          incorrectly sometimes. He provided a patch.</li>

          <li>FontForge used not to create ghost hints for curved
          splines. It does now.</li>

          <li>FontForge did not find some of the hints needed for
          n021004l.pfb</li>

          <li>New French UI</li>

          <li>FontForge would sometimes crash when autotracing
          characters</li>

          <li>Don't snap to points when moving control points</li>

          <li>Directory browsing didn't work if the local encoding
          wasn't latin1 and the directory name contain non-ascii
          characters.</li>

          <li>Add an entry to find problems to look for 'GSUB'
          entries to non-existent characters.</li>

          <li>Expanded the simplify more command</li>

          <li>The GPOS output routines got very unhappy if a
          duplicate glyph happened to have GPOS data. Fixed on both
          ends I hope.</li>

          <li>The pcf reader was unhappy if

            <ul>
              <li>the glyph bb width was a multiple of 8 (we read
              an extra byte per line which made the result appear
              as garbage)</li>

              <li>several glyphs had the same name.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>the FontInfo dlg failed to parse the merge_with field
          of Anchor Classes properly, meaning that each time [OK]
          was pressed in fontinfo each anchor class name got a
          number prepended to it.</li>

          <li>Change the way the merge_with field of anchor classes
          is handled by the UI so that it makes more sense. We used
          to display a number, now display the name of another
          anchor class with which it can be merged.</li>

          <li>Added an arabic text sample, courtesy of Thomas
          Milo.</li>

          <li>Upgraded to Unicode 4.0 (<span class=
          "c1"><strong>Note: <a href=
          "http://libuninameslist.sf.net/">libuninameslist</a> has
          also been upgraded</strong></span>)</li>

          <li>Added a new preference item CharCenterHighest to
          assist in accent placement.
            <hr />
          </li>

          <li>Oh. This isn't documented, but each langsys table can
          only point to one (1) feature with a given tag. So if I
          have multiple 'mark' lookups, I can't have multiple
          'mark' features, I must have one 'mark' feature with
          pointers to many lookups.</li>

          <li>FontForge could crash when generating a tfm file from
          a CID keyed font</li>

          <li>Change GDEF output so that the class def table isn't
          generated when it isn't needed (we used to generate a 0
          length one, which would confuse the freetype-1 opentype
          code, and perhaps others).</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug in autohint caused by negative stem
          widths.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>4-July-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Added a page to the font info dlg which allows users
          to set TeX font parameters</li>

          <li>Added a mechanism for specifying TeX charlists and
          extension characters</li>

          <li>Added a mechanism for specifying TeX Italic
          Correction</li>

          <li>Revamped support for reading tfm files so that it
          sets all these new things correctly.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>2-July-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Add an Options dialog to the Generate Font window,
          and remove the check boxes from it.

            <ul>
              <li>Add a UI for the 'PfEd' table</li>

              <li>Add a UI to turn off PostScript hinting</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>FontForge can now generate a tfm and enc file (for
          TeX)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>30-June-2003

        <ul>
          <li>I<span class="c1"><strong>n the table of contents at
          the start of a true/open type file the GDEF table was
          listed as having the wrong size. This caused many
          applications to ignore it, which in turn meant that Mark
          to Base GPOS tables were ignored</strong></span> (at
          least I hope that's what was going on).</li>

          <li>On the mac local help files weren't working
          properly.</li>

          <li>Combining unicode characters (mark glyphs) should
          have an advance width of 0, and now they default to
          that.</li>

          <li>Several people at EuroTeX wanted more pen shapes in
          the expand stroke dlg. Ellipses are easy, so we add
          them.</li>

          <li>One guy at EuroTeX wanted to be able to store
          arbitrary per-glyph data in the font, so add a new
          (private) true/open type table that can contain the glyph
          comments. This table has tag 'PfEd' and can contain
          sub-tables containing font comment, glyph comments, glyph
          colors. Perhaps other data as need arises.</li>

          <li>Kanou has added a new scripting command, SizeOf, to
          return the number of elements in an array.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>19-June-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Added a histogram dialog to help figure values for
          StemSnap[H/V]</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>17-June-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Scripting interface to SelectByATT</li>

          <li>Crash bug caused by incorrect CID fix on 15-June</li>

          <li>(the web interface to the cvs tree seems broken. It
          doesn't show rmligamarks). Here's a copy of <a href=
          "rmligamarks.c">rmligamarks.c</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>15-June-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Cleaned up the spelling of some scripts.</li>

          <li>Deactive the [Edit] button of the Script/Lang list
          when appropriate.</li>

          <li>FontForge wasn't removing the quotes around the
          copyright notice when read from a bdf file. After several
          rounds of read/save there were lots of quotes.</li>

          <li>Added a wireframe effect.</li>

          <li>Added a find problems entry which will check for
          control points which are very close to their main point
          (so close that it is unlikely that they will effect the
          curve much).</li>

          <li>The Undo command from the font view did not reset the
          character changed bit.</li>

          <li>GDEF table output had problems with cid-keyed
          fonts.</li>

          <li>So did 'prop' table output.</li>

          <li>Expanded View-&gt;Show ATT to show 'GDEF', 'lcar',
          'prop', 'opbd' tables.</li>

          <li>Added a Ligatures entry for View-&gt;Combinations in
          the outline character view</li>

          <li>Added "Edit-&gt;Select-&gt;Select by ATT", to allow
          user to select characters depending on advanced
          typographic features.</li>

          <li>
            <span class="c1"><strong>FontForge always used to set
            the "ignore-combining-marks" flag bit for all

            other hand I believe some arabic ligatures may depend
            on it (at least arabtype-volt.ttf uses it). So... now
            we only set this bit for arabic ligatures which do not
            contain combining marks. Dunno if that is right
            either.</strong></span>

            <ul>
              <li>I have created a little tool, <a href=

              rmligamarks</a>, which will take an sfd file with the
              "ignore combining marks" bit in ligatures and turn it
              off. It does not try to guess what should be done, it
              ALWAYS turns the bit off.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

      </li>

      <li>5-June-2003

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge was generating Apple 'morx' tables with the
          right to left bit reversed (so it thought latin text was
          right to left and arabic was left to right). This meant
          that ligatures happened backwards (the "ffi" ligature
          would be invoked if you typed in "iff")</li>

          <li>FontForge was generating a format=1 glyph class
          definition sub-table of GDEF. ttx didn't like this, I'm
          not sure why. Problem goes away if I generate a format=2
          sub-table.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>4-Jun-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Added a Shadow effect</li>

          <li>More fixes for remove overlap</li>

          <li>fixed a bug with timers</li>

          <li>Preserve the Fit To Em mode of a font.</li>

          <li>Added a bunch of scripts (as in writing systems, not
          executable files) from the proposed ISO 15924
          standard.</li>

          <li>Added support for underline position to bdf
          files.</li>

          <li>The 18-May build was bad and failed to read
          postscript fonts properly on many platforms (the sources
          were ok, but the builds were bad)</li>

          <li>Display the version number in the about box, and
          attach it to the directory in the source .tgz file.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>18-May-2003

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge would crash when asked to produce a ttf
          font where there was an unused anchor class.</li>

          <li>The original encoding is now preserved when a font is
          generated.</li>

          <li>The goto dialog (and scripting) now recognize
          "glyph&lt;nnn&gt;" as refering to glyph &lt;nnn&gt; in
          the original encoding.</li>

          <li>Kanou provided two scripting commands, ConvertToCID
          and ConvertByCMap.</li>

          <li>Added a Remove External flag to Expand Stroke to
          complement Kanou's Remove Internal</li>

          <li>Expanded on Remove Overlap by adding

            <ul>
              <li>Intersection -- which removes everything except
              the overlap</li>

              <li>Exclude -- which removes areas where any selected
              contours cross non-selected contours (and then
              removes the selected contours)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Added an Effects sub-menu of Elements, including (so
          far)

            <ul>
              <li>Outline -- turns the selected characters into
              outline versions of themselves</li>

              <li>Inline -- turns the selected characters into
              inline versions of themselves</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>FontForge would crash when reading in an sfd file
          containing a kerning class</li>

          <li>gimp objected to some of my ttf fonts. I think
          because it is inappropriately clipping to the
          ascent/descent values in the hhea rather than using the
          font's bounding box. It's easy enough to preserve the
          'hhea' ascent/descent values and perhaps that will be
          enough to make gimp happy.</li>

          <li>Kanou points out that rasterization has problems with
          the new TOfNextMajor, so use the new code for remove
          overlap and friends and the old code for
          rasterization</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>12-May-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Added a command to do non-linear transformations (but
          made it require user configuration to have it
          compiled)</li>

          <li>Added a UI for Kanou's Remove Internal flag to Expand
          stroke</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>9-May-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Apple's 'lcar' (ligature caret) table was being
          generated incorrectly</li>

          <li>Another bug in point numbering</li>

          <li>Make "Slanted" a synonym for Oblique.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>8-May-2003

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge did not recognize "filename(fontname)"
          notation for loading a specific font from a resource fork
          of a mac file.</li>

          <li>FontForge crashed on the mac when generating a GPOS
          table. There was an uninitialized variable there, left
          behind be recent changes. Removed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>7-May-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Oops. It should be legal for a 'mkmk' anchor class to
          have two points in a glyph, one the normal mark point,
          the other the base mark point. (that is it should be
          possible for a glyph to attach to itself).</li>

          <li>Kanou supplied a patch to extend expand stroke.</li>

          <li>Changed behavior of AnchorClasses so that two classes
          could be associated to form a single feature (ie. one
          class of "Above" marks, and one class of "Below"
          marks)</li>

          <li>Show ATT now displays something meaningful for
          marks</li>

          <li>Some general Anchor Class clean up.</li>

          <li>Was not setting bits in the CodePage[1] field of the
          OS/2 table for all the weird MS specific encodings. It
          seems I should do that.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>6-May-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Although undocumented, digits behave just like lower
          case letters in macintosh filenames for postscript
          resource fonts.
            <hr />
          </li>

          <li>Looking at the font info-&gt;ttf values dialog would
          cause fontforge to crash after [Ok] was pressed.</li>

          <li>Old sfd files with anchor classes but not script lang
          index would crash fontforge when being read in.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>5-May-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Made it possible to select kerning class 0 (ie.
          everything that isn't specified)</li>

          <li>Put in a check to make sure the user didn't add a
          glyph to two different kerning classes</li>

          <li><span class="c1"><strong>FontForge was dumping out a
          full GSUB sub-table for each character that sub-table
          applied to (rather than one sub-table for all
          characters). So there were tons of
          duplicates.</strong></span></li>

          <li><span class="c1"><strong>FontForge was producing
          extension sub-tables that held an incorrect
          offset.</strong></span></li>

          <li>Added some code to protect FontForge when it read
          incorrect ttf fonts like those generated above.</li>

          <li>Drag and Drop to the Char Info dlg was broken.</li>

          <li>If a font had a non-notdef character at encoding 0
          and we used freetype to generate bitmaps for it, then
          those bitmaps would be assigned to the wrong glyphs (ie.
          the bitmap for "A" would go to "B", etc.)</li>

          <li>I used "Mac Roman" in several places where I should
          have said "Macintosh Latin"</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>4-May-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Added code to determine better defaults for the
          script lang index</li>

          <li>The ligature state table in Apple Chancery has so
          many possible paths through it that FontForge bogs down
          when evaluating it. I presume it would finish in finite
          time, but it takes unacceptably long. So I've put in an
          abort.</li>

          <li>Add support for KernClasses (ie. they are no longer
          just converted into a large number of kernpairs, but will
          be stored internally as a set class and will be output as
          such). And they have their own dialogs to manage
          them.</li>

          <li>Add support for Apple's new version of the 'kern'
          table.</li>

          <li>Add support for the format 2 sub table of Apple's
          'kern' table (which is different from OpenType's format 2
          sub-table of the kern table), and is Apple's kerning
          class sub-table (note: <a href=
          "http://developer.apple.com/fonts/TTRefMan/RM06/Chap6kern.html">
          Apple's docs</a> are <span class=
          "c1"><small><strong>WRONG</strong></small></span>. they
          claim class data are stored in an array of uint8, but
          they really are in an array of uint16).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>29-Apr-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Oops, one more fix to remove overlap</li>

          <li>Kanou points out that copy hasn't been working (for
          some time now) when a contour has be split into bits,
          only one of the bits is copied.</li>

          <li>Kanou points out that Paste reorders open
          contours</li>

          <li>Further work on Show ATT dlg</li>

          <li>Further work on multiple features.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>28-Apr-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Yet more fixes for Remove overlap</li>

          <li>Added a mode to the ruler tool where it shows the
          exact position of the mouse cursor</li>

          <li>The Goto command had a strange bug: If a font had a
          glyph with a known name, but that glyph did not reside at
          the unicode slot assigned to that name, then goingto that
          name would go to the (empty) unicode slot, rather than to
          the actually character.</li>

          <li>Werner wants a <a href="showatt.html">dlg</a> which
          shows collects all the GPOS/GSUB (morx/kern) information
          in one place rather than scattering it around hundreds of
          dlgs.</li>

          <li>FontForge now stores the script/langs for kern
          pairs</li>

          <li>FontForge failed to read script/langs for GPOS
          properly.</li>

          <li>FontForge had problems generating an AFM file from a
          CID font with ligatures</li>

          <li>FontForge had problems getting script lang lists
          right when multiple features refered to the same
          lookup.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>20-Apr-2003

        <ul>
          <li>One of FontForge's deficiencies is that it handles
          multiple encodings for the same glyph very badly (it does
          not have the multiple layers of indirection that fonts
          do). Rather than solve this properly I have added a new
          command that allows for this case. <a href=
          "editmenu.html#SameGlyphAs">SameGlyphAs</a>.</li>

          <li>Add some more synonyms for greek glyph names</li>

          <li>Failed to realize that U+1FED was an accent</li>

          <li>No longer tries to build greek accents out of latin
          ones when Build Accented is invoked. (but still will for
          Build Composite).</li>

          <li>When swapping character names, check for names like
          "uniXXXX" and instead of swapping it, rebuild it as
          appropriate for the other character.</li>

          <li>Font Info-&gt;Encoding failed to change the encoding
          properly when switching from "Compacted" to anything
          other than the original encoding.</li>

          <li>A couple of changes to the italian translation</li>

          <li>Added an "Original" encoding which gives you back the
          ordering of the glyphs in the ttf font. (this may be
          changed when you regenerate a ttf font)</li>

          <li>FontForge failed to read ttf instructions for
          composite glyphs.</li>

          <li>FontForge got confused if a ttf file had multiple
          glyphs named ".notdef" (which to me looks like a bug in
          the ttf font, but Times New Roman does this so I have to
          deal with it).</li>

          <li>Added a command to the popup menu in the charview to
          bring up a window looking at a reference.</li>

          <li>Add a check for when sfd files contain bad kerning
          info.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>14-Apr-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Change a tab in Font Info from "PS General" to
          "General"</li>

          <li>When searching for encoding files, look for the
          extension ".enc" used by TeX for PostScript encoding
          files</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash when setting a character's name to a
          name already given to another character</li>

          <li>Added many new X resources for controlling colors in
          the outline character view.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>7-Apr-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Program generated divide by zero errors when using
          Meta-Shift to move a control point which didn't
          exist.</li>

          <li>(cleaned up some syntax issues in non-English nomen
          files)</li>

          <li>Added new scripting commands ClearPrivateEntry,
          ChangePrivateEntry, GetPrivateEntry</li>

          <li>Added new scripting command: UnicodeFromName</li>

          <li>Added new script command: RemoveATT</li>

          <li>Vadim pointed out that loading "pala.ttf" and then
          generating it again (as ttf) produced bad results.
          FontForge was getting confused by the points which were
          used to control Anchors, getting its points list out of
          order and generally screwing up.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>04-Apr-2003

        <ul>
          <li>autosave sometimes lost track of which font it should
          be applying changes to.t</li>

          <li>Add Extrema (or just adding a point in the middle of
          a spline) would generate incorrect splines if the spline
          were linear in one but not both of the two
          dimensions</li>

          <li>One more change to Merge/Simplify. Deal with the case
          of a curve point with no control point (use the control
          point in the opposite direction to get the slope).</li>

          <li>Typo in 2-Apr script/lang fix caused crashes.</li>

          <li>TeXBaseEncoding (T1) changed in Oct-2002. Updated my
          version (also updated the other TeX encodings I've got
          and included the cyrillic ones into Encodings.ps.gz)</li>

          <li>Sometimes we failed to remove the dot when creating a
          dotless i/j character.</li>

          <li>Merge/Simplify had conniptions when given a zero
          length spline.</li>

          <li>Added "DefaultATT" and "AddATT" scripting command to
          allow user to add Advanced Typography features to
          characters.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>2-Apr-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Problems with script/lang when: Pasting or Merging
          ligatures and substitutions from one font to another</li>

          <li>FontForge could generate points (within a ttf simple
          glyph) in a different than the original glyph, meaning
          that the instructions would move the wrong point
          resulting in blots. I have fixed this (or at least the
          cases I found).</li>

          <li>FontForge would always give ASCII characters their
          standard names in a ttf post table. This was wrong if the
          character did not have its standard name.</li>

          <li>FontForge could go into an infinite loop on some
          simplifies.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>1-Apr-2003 (April Fish!)

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a crash in the Join command</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash when loading some truetype fonts (never
          bothered to figure which ones exactly)</li>

          <li>Fixed a similar crash when loading old sfd files
          (note some old fonts won't guess the script for
          ligatures, etc. properly)</li>

          <li>Added a new preference item: Stop At Join</li>

          <li>Changed the way control points are set when changing
          point type.</li>

          <li>The fill of the outline view sometimes lagged the
          change.</li>

          <li>Added another tag to CharInfo scripting command:
          GlyphIndex. It returns the glyph number in the ttf
          font.</li>

          <li>Werner suggests that instead of naming things
          "nounicode-%x" where %x is the encoding, use
          "nounicode-%d-%d-%x" where the two new arguments are the
          platform/specific pair used in the cmap we picked.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>31-Mar-2003

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge was not reading pfb fonts properly if they
          had more than one binary section header.</li>

          <li>When FontForge removed a character it did not remove
          all the kernpairs that refered to that character.</li>

          <li>Fixed more leaks with valgrind.</li>

          <li>Added more synonyms for glyph names from Adobe Glyph
          List (I still rely on Glyph names for New Fonts as my
          basic set of names)</li>

          <li>FontForge had problems if the use selected 0 levels
          of undoes when the UI was active.</li>

          <li>Selecting the freehand tool in a quadratic font
          caused a crash. (The freehand tool doesn't work in
          quadratic fonts, but it shouldn't crash)</li>

          <li>Changed the way scripts are specified. I used to
          assign a script to every character. I realize that
          doesn't work. The digits are used in many scripts and the
          fraction ligatures based on them need to be seen in all
          those scripts, not just the one that the digit was
          assigned to. So...

            <ul>
              <li>Glyphs no longer have a script assigned to
              them</li>

              <li>Substitutions, Ligatures, Anchor Classes and
              other Advanced Typographic features now have a list
              of scripts (and languages) for which they are
              active.</li>

              <li>There is now an absurdly complex <a href=
              "charinfo.html#Feature-Tag">stream of dialogs</a>
              which may be used to set this list.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Added a new preference item to allow the user to
          specify a local help directory</li>

          <li>Added a new scripting command SelectIf which allows
          you to determine whether a character is in a font (Select
          signals an error if the character isn't there, SelectIf
          returns failure).</li>

          <li>Added a new scripting command to change a font's
          order (from quadratic to cubic)</li>

          <li>ScaleToEm scripting command will now accept a single
          argument, the em-size.</li>

          <li>Added a new scripting command to allow you to apply
          an otf substitution to the font</li>

          <li>Added a new scripting command to give control over
          which ligatures are output in an afm file

            <ul>
              <li>(it used to be that all ligatures were output in
              the afm file, no only 'liga' and 'rlig' that appear
              in a default language are output)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>AFM files only support 2 character ligatures. So,
          when possible, generate a sort of closure on the
          ligatures. So if we are given the two ligs "ffi-&gt;f f
          i" and "ff-&gt;f f" then add the ligature "ffi-&gt;ff i".
          This means that the sequence f+f-&gt;ff+i-&gt;ffi will
          eventually reach the ligature we want.</li>

          <li>Changed so that an untitled anchor class is now
          called "Anchor-*" rather than "Untitled-*".</li>

          <li>Rewrote Merge &amp; Simplify commands. In my tests
          they now produce better results.</li>

          <li>Type2 font generation did not make use of hv/vh
          curveto commands in some cases</li>

          <li>When figuring out whether to synchronize the
          width/lbearing of a base character with the composites
          containing it, I only checked if the base character was
          alphabetic. But that doesn't work for hebrew where
          unicode says the marks are alphabetic. So add an
          additional check that it can't be a combining
          character.</li>

          <li>When pasting a composite character from one font to
          another, the saved width is not useful. Added a check
          that finds the correct width of the appropriate base
          character.</li>

          <li>When pasting a composite character from a font with
          one em-size to another with a different em-size try to
          scale the amount references are translated by an
          appropriate amount.</li>

          <li>CharInfo scripting command has been extended to allow
          users to test the presence of substitutions</li>

          <li>Some fonts (bsmi00lp.ttf for one) have bad cmap
          tables which map several glyphs to the same unicode code
          point. Put in a check for this and only map one glyph to
          that code point now.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>13-Mar-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Add a preference item to control the number of undoes
          saved per character</li>

          <li>Turn off saving undoes when in a script started from
          the command line</li>

          <li>Added a preference item to control the undo depth
          from the UI.</li>

          <li>Try to do better about scaling my chunk allocator to
          machines with 8 byte pointers</li>

          <li>Was doing 32 bit arithmetic when reading GSUB simple
          substitution lookups when I should have done 16 bit.</li>

          <li>Tracked down a lot of memory leaks with valgrind (and
          some uninitialized variables too)</li>

          <li>Added access to a font's version from scripting</li>

          <li>Added PostNotice scripting command</li>

          <li>When reading a ttf/otf font with a GSUB table
          fontforge will try to guess reasonable names for unnamed
          glyphs by looking them up in the GSUB table. Thus an
          unnamed vertical variant for "A" might be named
          "A.vrt2".</li>

          <li>FontForge would crash when outputting ttf files with
          no 'cvt' table (bug introduced around 27-Feb)</li>

          <li>the configure script did not respect the argument
          --with-freetype-src as it should have.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>10-Mar-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Added a TrueType instruction debugger (actually an
          interface to FreeType's truetype bytecode interpreter)

            <table border="1" cellpadding="6" width="50%" align=
            "center">
              <tr>
                <td class="c3">
                  This command depend on your compiling freetype
                  with the byte code interpreter enabled. This is
                  disabled by default because it infringes on
                  certain <a href=
                  "http://freetype.sourceforge.net/patents.html">patents
                  granted to Apple</a>. If you have a license from
                  Apple then you may enable the interpreter by
                  setting the appropriate macro in
                  .../include/freetype/config/ftoption.h before you
                  build the library (see the README.UNX file on the
                  top level of the freetype distribution).

                  <p>FontForge needs to have the freetype source
                  directories available when it is built (there are
                  some include files there which it depends on)</p>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </li>

          <li>Added an Edit-&gt;Copy Grid Fit command (to put the
          grid fit splines into the clipboard)</li>

          <li>Added a warning if the freetype library doesn't have
          a byte code interpreter so that the user knows his/her
          splines have been autohinted (rather than had the
          bytecode instructions run).</li>

          <li>Improved Edit-&gt;Merge in some cases that don't fit
          its constraints</li>

          <li>KANOU found some more underscores in character
          names</li>

          <li>And provided a new japanese ui</li>

          <li>Round to Int had problems on quadratic splines</li>

          <li>Added support for runtime loading of dynamic
          libraries on the mac.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>03-Mar-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Memory got screwed up when converting TTF splines to
          PS ones</li>

          <li>KANOU suggested some changes to the quadratic spline
          UI</li>

          <li>I had the wrong makefile at top level so builds
          didn't</li>

          <li>syntax error on systems without freetype</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>02-Mar-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Changed the Show Instructions command to be an Edit
          Instructions</li>

          <li>Bug saving 'prep' table</li>

          <li>Bug changing 'cvt ' table</li>

          <li>Added ability to look at gridfit splines in
          charview.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>28-Feb-2003

        <ul>
          <li>New dialog in outline view to examine ttf
          instructions</li>

          <li>If an sfd file was created from a script then when it
          was next opened from the UI it would appear in a tiny
          window.</li>

          <li>The preference item refering to the []Hint check box
          in the generate dlg has been renamed.</li>

          <li>A checksum-like thing has been added to ui files so
          that in the future the application will refuse to use .ui
          files which do not match its expectations.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>27-Feb-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Didn't get the SetLBearing change right
          yesterday.</li>

          <li>Changing to quadratic splines with Font Info could
          generate an invalid spline.</li>

          <li>We now preserve truetype instructions when reading in
          a truetype file (the fpgm and prep tables, the cvt table
          and any per character instructions)</li>

          <li>These instructions will be dumped out when generating
          truetype fonts</li>

          <li>Added a menu command AutoInstr to generate our own
          (bad) instructions for a character.</li>

          <li>Any significant change (ie. anything that reorders
          the points, or adds or removes points) will clear the
          instructions for that character.</li>

          <li>Changing to cubic splines (fontwide) will clear the
          instructions (and the fpgm and prep tables).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>26-Feb-2003

        <ul>
          <li>configure scripts got confused in the freetype
          libraries were findable but the include files were not.
          Changed the scripts so that freetype is marked not
          present if the include files are missing.</li>

          <li>Table ordering was not read in properly from an sfd
          file</li>

          <li>Typos in SetCharName &amp; SetUnicodeValue prevented
          second argument from working</li>

          <li>Added a second argument to SetLBearing and friends to
          allow relative bearing settings (ie. to increment the
          bearing by some amount)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>25-Feb-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Bad bug in GSUB generation introduced yesterday</li>

          <li>Font level round 2 int command now rounds hints
          too.</li>

          <li>Adobe lies when they say that a hint can't stretch
          from one bluezone to another, so be a bit more cautious
          in removing this case.</li>

          <li>Be a little better about getting the script from the
          GSUB/GPOS table.
            <hr />
          </li>

          <li>FontForge had problems generating mac cursive
          connection setting.</li>

          <li>FontForge had problems defaulting ligatures in cid
          keyed fonts (even if there were no ligature characters to
          be defaulted, the attempt would fail)</li>

          <li>I introduced memory problems yesterday. Fixed.</li>

          <li>Font level round 2 int will take hints into account
          when positioning points in order to maintain stem widths.
            <hr />
          </li>

          <li>When running a script from the command line FontForge
          failed to initialize the adobe standard encoding.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>24-Feb-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Claudio Beccari has provided an Italian UI.</li>

          <li>(added Italian style translations to fontinfo)</li>

          <li>User now has the ability to control the conversion
          from mac feature/settings to otf features.</li>

          <li>FontForge now remembers the order features are to be
          applied in GSUB/GPOS/morx tables (and dumps features out
          in that order when it next saves them).</li>

          <li>FontForge allows you to reorder the GSUB/morx tables
          should you wish to do so. I am sufficiently ignorant that
          I don't believe it is necessary to reorder the GPOS
          table, so there is currently no UI for this. If I am
          wrong let me know and I will add that too.</li>

          <li>The 'kern' table was not being generated when it
          should have been. This error was introduced sometime in
          the last month due to the AAT changes.</li>

          <li>Scripts generating otf fonts would crash if the font
          had non-integral coordinates because of a bug in my
          PostNotice routine when running without X.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>18-Feb-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Hmm. It looks as though apple uses the "ascending
          glyph" flag on the features of the 'mort'/'morx' tables
          to mean left to right text</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash on reading a GSUB table with a glyph
          out of range.</li>

          <li>Added support for a cursive connection (contextual
          glyph substitution subtable of) morx.</li>

          <li>Added an <a href="realindex.html">index</a> to this
          manual and put a link to it in FontForge's Help menu.
          Index is by no means complete yet.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>12-Feb-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Support direct editing of quadratic (truetype)
          splines</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>11-Feb-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Change made on 8 Feb 2003 broke the code that read
          type1 flex hints</li>

          <li>Hide files beginning with "." (except for "..") in
          file chooser dlgs.</li>

          <li>Add protections in the afm file output to handle very
          long copyright notices.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>08-Feb-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Support for Apple's 'opbd' (Optical Bounds)
          table</li>

          <li>Support for reading some features in non-contextual
          glyph and ligature sub-tables of the 'mort' or 'morx'
          tables.</li>

          <li>Support for writing those features in non-contextual
          glyph and ligature sub-tables of 'morx'.</li>

          <li>added char info to the fontview popup.</li>

          <li>the scripting command Generate (and GenerateFamily)
          would generate truetype .dfont files when asked to
          generate otf dfont files.</li>

          <li>Add ClearHints scripting command</li>

          <li>Add access to preference items from scripting (via:
          $&lt;prefname&gt;, GetPref("&lt;prefname&gt;"),
          SetPref("&lt;prefname&gt;",&lt;value&gt;)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>01-Feb-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Add some support for Apple Advanced Typography tables
          ('prop', 'lcar')</li>

          <li>Popup menus in textfields failed to refresh the text
          field</li>

          <li>KANOU provides a patch for sfd files with long
          Alternate Subs</li>

          <li>FontView didn't deselect properly after doing a drag
          and drop.</li>

          <li>Should now deal with the case where (under cygwin)
          the user sets BROWSER to 'netscape' with no path
          spec.</li>

          <li>Ligature carets introduced a crash bug.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>30-Jan-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Should figure out the default windows browser under
          cygwin now.</li>

          <li>Should handle the case where a user sets the BROWSER
          variable to something with a DOS pathspec</li>

          <li>Apply KANOU's patch to turn off more
          autohinting.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>29-Jan-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Fix a crash introduced yesterday.</li>

          <li>scripting didn't work for $familyname fix from Alex
          Raftis</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>28-Jan-2003

        <ul>
          <li>The title of the Anchor Pair dialog was wrong (said
          Kern Pairs)</li>

          <li>Improved error messages for when a font file did not
          exist or was unreadable.</li>

          <li>Failed to generate a GSUB table when the ligatures
          came from a r2l ttf file.</li>

          <li>I was generating incorrect data for r2l GPOS kerning
          sub-tables.</li>

          <li>Failed to display r2l anchored attachments properly
          in the metricsview, anchor pair dlg, or when
          printing.</li>

          <li>Typo when loading libuninameslist dynamic library,
          introduced on the 24th.</li>

          <li>Now we generate a GDEF table too, containing
          (possibly) a glyph class def and (possibly) a ligature
          caret list</li>

          <li>Added code for editing horizontal ligature caret
          locations</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>25-Jan-2003

        <ul>
          <li>More cygwin fixes for invoking browsers.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>24-Jan-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Added a preference item to control whether
          autohinting happens before a font is generated.</li>

          <li>When calling Internet Explorer or Netscape on cygwin
          we needed double backslashes</li>

          <li>moved hidden menu items (those invoked by Shift) into
          submenus</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>20-Jan-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Put in a number of errors and warnings related to a
          glyph not having a script.</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash bug when generating a popup for a glyph
          with no unicode encoding</li>

          <li>Support for scroll wheels.</li>

          <li>I hope I've now fixed the problems related to the
          GSUB table and ttc files. Now does a pass through the
          GSUB table to see what glyphs can be introduced by it
          when it figures out what glyphs to read from the glyph
          table (ttc files have more than one font sharing the
          table, don't want to read all glyphs).</li>

          <li>Added support for extension subtables of
          GPOS/GSUB.</li>

          <li>Making a selection in the textfield of the Display
          dlg was broken when the selection was scrolled.</li>

          <li>Valek wants a Paste Into command.</li>

          <li>Uninitialized variable in GSUB output caused erratic
          ligature behavior</li>

          <li>I'm told that even though it makes logical sense for
          hebrew to have a 'fina' tag, it is not customary and I
          have been asked to remove it from Default ATT. Which I
          have done.
            <hr />
          </li>

          <li>FontForge now protects itself better against
          erroneous GSUB/GPOS tables.</li>

          <li>Valek points out there were display problems with the
          File-&gt;Display (and File-&gt;Print) menu options in
          Russian.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>16-Jan-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Recent char info changes broke copy &amp; paste
          within text fields of the char info dlg.</li>

          <li>Problems reading GSUB table of a ttc files (problems
          remain, but we should no longer crash).</li>

          <li>Reorganized libraries. Now FontForge has an
          additional dependency:<br />
          <a href=
          "http://libuninameslist.sf.net">libuninameslist</a>.
          Please install this.</li>

          <li>With libuninameslist FontForge can display the
          Unicode annotation information.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>14-Jan-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a couple of bugs loading pcf files with complex
          encodings</li>

          <li>Bug in pasting metadata when there was no glyph
          comment.</li>

          <li>Made SetCharColor scripting command set the color on
          any selected glyphs</li>

          <li>Cleaned up selection behavior in fontview. Drag &amp;
          drop made it difficult</li>

          <li>Oops. Was scaling round rect radius incorrectly in
          xfig conversion</li>

          <li>Oh yes, hebrew has final letters too. And greek. Add
          them in to the default for 'fina'.</li>

          <li>Fixed many problems with mac font generation</li>

          <li>Open VMS update from Jauk Jansen</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>12-Jan-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Support for xkb extension</li>

          <li>New Russian UI from Valek</li>

          <li>New Japanese UI from KANOU
            <hr />
          </li>

          <li>Saving a compacted font did not preserve the old
          encoding</li>

          <li>Added a preference item to control Edit-&gt;Join</li>

          <li>made Edit-&gt;Copy From-&gt;Copy Name (now Metadata)
          be a preference item too.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>9-Jan-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Support for round rects in xfig files</li>

          <li>Added the glyph name to the title of the char info
          dlg</li>

          <li>Char info failed to deal with all the flags
          properly</li>

          <li>Fixed crash when creating GPOS sub-table 1 (simple
          positioning)</li>

          <li>GPOS/GSUB output now handles case where a feature has
          several different sets of flags.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>8-Jan-2003

        <ul>
          <li>Update copyright notices</li>

          <li>Printing now handles anchored marks. (Display does
          not, just as display doesn't handle kerning-- because X
          doesn't).</li>

          <li>Support for cursive positioning.</li>

          <li>I've registered with Adobe, and they have assigned
          FontForge an XUID base number of 1021. Now when new users
          start fontforge for the first time they will be assigned
          an XUID base sequence of 1021 xxx nnn where xxx and nnn
          are two random numbers generated by fontforge. New fonts
          will get a fourth number for their full XUID.</li>

          <li>Kanou points out that glyph names should not contain
          underscores so redo the .cidmap files to change to
          dashes. Also change "japan1_%d" to "cid-%d" to make life
          easier for me.</li>

          <li>KANOU points out there were places where fontforge
          did not check psunicodenames_cnt. Once outside of BMP
          this causes a crash.</li>

          <li>New Japanese UI from KANOU.</li>

          <li>Support for many more GPOS/GSUB sub-tables.</li>

          <li>Keep track of the order in which characters are
          selected in the fontview and recreate that order when
          user asks to create a metricsview based on the fontview's
          selection</li>

          <li>Make it possible to drag&amp;drop characters from
          fontview into metricsview (again keeping track of
          selection order)</li>

          <li>Make it possible to drag&amp;drop characters from
          fontview into charview to create references</li>

          <li>Make it possible to drag&amp;drop characters from
          fontview into charinfo to create ligatures, etc.</li>

          <li>Command to set the default values for sub GSUB/GPOS
          features that are easy for FontForge to figure out.</li>

          <li>Ability to zoom metrics view.</li>

          <li>Metrics view displays anchor points and does the
          needed work to position the characters. It is also
          possible to move anchor points around in the metrics
          view.</li>

          <li>Metrics view now has a pop-up menu that allows you to
          see alternate metrics</li>

          <li>Metrics view now has a submenu (off of View) which
          allows you to change the current glyph to one of its
          alternates.</li>

          <li>Fixed uninitialized variable what would sometimes
          cause a crash when storing bitmaps in a TTF/OTF
          file.</li>

          <li>Fixed crash bug in 29-Dec when generating a truetype
          font without a GPOS table.</li>

          <li>Many changes to charinfo dlg. Made non-modal. Can
          Copy/Paste Position/Substitution data.</li>

          <li>Do a minimal amount of work toward supporting the
          alpha channel of a png file.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>29-Dec-2002

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge now supports <a href=
          "overview.html#Anchors">anchor points</a> for mark to
          base (ligature and mark) positioning.</li>

          <li>FontForge was mistakenly treating NumLock on PC
          keyboards as if it were the command key on Mac
          keyboards.</li>

          <li>The font info dlg now remembers what tab was last
          pressed.</li>

          <li>The char info dlg has been restructured. It includes
          a script field, and associates a tag with the ligature
          (if any).</li>

          <li>I have decided to generate a 'GPOS' table rather than
          a 'kern' table in truetype output as well as in opentype
          output (unless applemode is set).</li>

          <li>I have changed the default names of items in adobe's
          private use area to match their new conventions. ie.
          names used to look like "Asmall" and now look like
          "a.sc".</li>

          <li>I have rewritten the way <a href="gposgsub.html">GPOS
          and GSUB</a> tables are output. I hope this will not have
          much effect on users, but it does mean that a few more
          sub-tables are now supported.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>23-Dec-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Various improvements to cubic-&gt;quadratic
          (truetype) conversion.</li>

          <li>When switching from displaying a 12,8,6,4,3,2,1pt
          bitmap to a 24pt anti-aliased version, fontforge would
          fail to update the display.</li>

          <li>The bitmap dlg would come up with the labels for X
          showing when it should have shown those for Win/Mac.</li>

          <li>Inspired by KANOU's mentioning the mona font, I've
          made it possible to generate an ms bitmap only ttf font.
          This is done by creating dummy glyph and loca tables
          (full of space glyphs) and putting a bitmap scaling table
          which causes the most likely pixelsizes to be scaled from
          the strikes available.

            <p>You can generate this with: [No Outline Font] [In
            TTF]</p>
          </li>

          <li>Drat. Fix of 24-Nov was wrong. I still wasn't putting
          the UniqueID into the Private dict.</li>

          <li>I've been generating bad macbinary files since I
          started

            <ul>
              <li>I had not noticed that the resource and data fork
              must be padded to a multiple of 128 bytes.

                <ul>
                  <li>This also meant that on rare occasions I
                  would read them incorrectly too.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>I was generating the crc incorrectly.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Be a bit more vigorous about displaying filter text
          in file choosers.</li>

          <li>Default buttons didn't respond to the keypad enter
          key.</li>

          <li>Pressing OK in the character info dlg would often
          destroy the font's encoding event when it should not
          have.</li>

          <li>Was generating bad kerning tables for mac FONDs.</li>

          <li>Jim Killock reminds me that there was no way for
          fontforge to read kerning data from a mac FOND.
          File-&gt;Merge Kern Data will now accept a mac resource
          file.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>15-Dec-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Add support for Big5HKSCS</li>

          <li>Redo CJK encodings</li>

          <li>Update cidmap files.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>14-Dec-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Add support for reading windows .FON and .FNT
          files.</li>

          <li>Add support for writing windows .FNT files. Sadly
          .FNT files aren't particularly useful. They need to be
          converted to .FON files with the resource editor
          somehow.</li>

          <li>Bug when reading postscript files that included
          complicated combinations of translate scale and concat
          commands.</li>

          <li>FontForge was a bit too cavalier about guessing how
          big serifs were. Caused problems when autokerning a
          fraktur font. (FontForge thought it had huge serifs when
          it had none).</li>

          <li>Direction (Clockwise, counterclockwise, correct) menu
          items are now greyed out if the selected path is
          open.</li>

          <li>New OpenVms patches from Jacob Jansen.</li>

          <li>Update unicode database to 3.2</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>13-Dec-2002

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge will now open a ttf/otf font that contains
          only bitmap strikes</li>

          <li>FontForge will now read NFNT resources (old mac
          bitmaps)</li>

          <li>FontForge will import NFNT resources</li>

          <li>Fixed a number of problems with loading and saving
          bdf files

            <ul>
              <li>Did not understand that the "ENCODING" keyword
              could take two values if the first were -1</li>

              <li>Added unencoded glyphs at the wrong encoding (I
              know that sounds like an oxymoron. I assign them an
              encoding, and I did it badly).</li>

              <li>If a font name were not one of the X Logical Font
              Names then fontforge might fail to give the font a
              familyname or a fontname. This caused more problems
              when generating a new bdf file.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>11-Dec-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Revert Glyph is now undoable</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash when pressing return in the font
          display of a bitmap font.</li>

          <li>Display the name of references near the top of the
          reference in the outline char view.</li>

          <li>Took the width display off the info line and did it
          as hints are displayed.</li>

          <li>Menus now respond to Home and End key events.</li>

          <li>I have changed the calling conventions for the
          ExpandStroke scripting command to reflect the height
          ratio value that is now needed.</li>

          <li>Holding down the Alt (Meta) key when using the
          freehand tool will now close the path.</li>

          <li>The Generate Fonts dlg will now display an
          appropriate bitmap fontname if "No Outline Font" is
          selected.</li>

          <li>I think I've got the wacom stuff working now.
          FreeHand tool now takes options.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>08-Dec-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Oops. Can't use Alt-Shift for menus (it's treated as
          a mnemonic) use Alt-Ctl-Shift instead.</li>

          <li>Reorganized the prefs dlg.</li>

          <li>Made FontInfo non-modal.</li>

          <li>Added a default icon for all fontforge's windows
          &amp; dlgs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>06-Dec-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a problem where FontForge still picked bad
          fonts sometimes.</li>

          <li>Typo in format spec for character windows</li>

          <li>At Werner's suggestion:

            <ul>
              <li>The Transform dlg now preserves hints in the
              undo</li>

              <li>Added an indication of which layer was
              active</li>

              <li>Added an indication on the title bar that a
              character was changed</li>

              <li>Added a Revert Glyph command</li>

              <li>The location of the advance width pops up on the
              info line when the cursor moves over the advance
              width</li>

              <li>changed the Set Width command to get the right
              default value.</li>

              <li>There were some layout problems in the char info
              dlg.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Redid the configuration for mac os/x. I've just
          upgraded to the new developers' tools and that fixed a
          lot of problems.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>05-Dec-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a crash in menus, if the cursor was moved from
          a submenu (a cascaded menu) to the menubar without
          passing through the main menu then a crash would
          happen.</li>

          <li>Clicking in a menu above the first line will dismiss
          the menu.</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash when generating postscript fonts.</li>

          <li>Oops. Bug in work of 2-Dec. The character named "u"
          was treated as uXXXX and given unicode U+0000 rather than
          U+0075.</li>

          <li>It is now possible to switch between editing layers
          in the outline character view by using the mnemonics
          displayed in the layers palette (even if the layers
          palette is hidden).

            <p>Or by using the popup menu invoked by the third
            mouse button.</p>
          </li>

          <li>Rewrote Expand Stroke so that the calligraphic pen is
          no longer treated as a line (it is now treated as a
          rectangle).</li>

          <li>Changed behavior of Next/Prev char so that they do
          not wrap in the outline character view. Also added the
          encoding to the title.</li>

          <li>In the outline view made a separate menu entry for
          Char Info and removed it from "Get Info". Made Ctl-Shft-I
          invoke Char Info in all views (Ctl-I will also invoke it
          everywhere but the outline view).</li>

          <li>Undo will now attempt to reset the modified bit on a
          character. It will not attempt to reset the modified bit
          on the font as a whole (there are too many things that
          can change without setting undo info).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>2-Dec-2002

        <ul>
          <li>If the fontview were only one line high FontForge
          would not scroll to the selected character properly.</li>

          <li>Adobe has released a new version of their glyph
          naming conventions. In particular they provide names for
          code points outside of the bmp. Danilo Sagan points out
          that they also allow for alternate glyph names.
          (specified in the <a href=
          "http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/otfdk/">FDK</a>).</li>

          <li>Remove the PFAEDIT_PI1 environment variable.</li>

          <li>Cut and Paste bug fixed when clearing metadata.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>25-Nov-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Harald Harders provides a patch to allow
          SetItalicAngle to deal with real numbers.</li>

          <li>Vadim Belman provides a patch to keep
          Element-&gt;MetaFont from crashing when applied to
          spaces.</li>

          <li>Bringing up the preference dlg would segfault if
          there were arguments specified for autotrace.</li>

          <li>Put in a hack so that the environment variable
          PFAEDIT_PI1 controls whether U+03D6 is named "pi1" (as
          Unicode suggests it ought to be) or "omega1" (as Adobe
          has said it should be).</li>

          <li>Follow riggle's suggestion and use the shell command
          "open" (on a Mac) to bring up a browser window.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>24-Nov-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Harald Harders points out that UniqueID needs to be
          in both the font and the Private dictionaries in a
          PostScript font.</li>

          <li>And provides access to UniqueID from the scripting
          language.</li>

          <li>More fixes for TeX sfd files.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>20-Nov-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Changed the Simplify More command to bring up a dlg
          giving the user control over what errors Simplify More is
          allowed to induce.</li>

          <li>Bug in import image with non-latin1 fontnames</li>

          <li>New Russian ui translation</li>

          <li>Merge fonts didn't work well with CID keyed
          fonts</li>

          <li>Fixed yet another problem with notdef
          generation.</li>

          <li>Fixed yet crash in sfddiff.</li>

          <li>Using Font Info to convert to SJIS didn't work.</li>

          <li>Merge fonts had problems when both fonts were CID
          keyed.</li>

          <li>Generate a unicode encoding subtable even when
          generating a CJK encoding subtable.</li>

          <li>Added a preference item to allow user to specify
          whether s/he would rather read in the unicode or the cjk
          encoding subtable.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>13-Nov-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Two new tools in the outline character view.

            <ul>
              <li>A hand tool -- for scrolling around</li>

              <li>A freehand tool -- for having fontforge try to
              fit splines to a hand drawn curve</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>MergeFonts was broken from scripts.</li>

          <li>New Russian UI from Valek.</li>

          <li>Another remove overlap fix from KANOU.</li>

          <li>Added code to invoke Internet Explorer (or an Mac
          App) on the Mac (so pressing F1 should actually load some
          help on the mac now).</li>

          <li>Fixed random crash in font generation dialog</li>

          <li>PS-&gt;TTF conversion tried to force splines in cases
          where it could not.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>05-Nov-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Improved behavior of Remove Overlap. Fix inspired by
          Kanou.</li>

          <li>Added a "Find Intersections" command, a variant of
          remove overlap that stops after it finds the
          intersections. I think this half of the job has no major
          bugs.</li>

          <li>If a single point is in the clipboard, then FontForge
          will also export the clipboard as STRING, giving the
          coordinates of the point. This is to make it easier to
          refer to the point.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>04-Nov-2002

        <ul>
          <li>KDE has the lovely habit of losing some resize events
          when in continuous resize mode. So I've tweaked the
          fontview resize code so that it is less dependent on
          individual events.</li>

          <li>Added a mode where the user can choose between
          whether the font shown in the fontview should be scaled
          so that the em fits in the space provided (this is the
          old behavior) or so that the bounding box does.</li>

          <li>Rewrote the knife tool so that it cuts at the end
          rather than as it goes along. I think this is easier to
          use.</li>

          <li>Bug in the generation of format=2 truetype encoding
          tables (used for CJK fonts).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>02-Nov-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Png reading failed on greyscale images with an alpha
          channel</li>

          <li>Png now reads mono images as mono.</li>

          <li>make install (via libtool) didn't work if "." weren't
          in the PATH.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>30-Oct-2002

        <ul>
          <li>GenerateFamily() scripting command had a number of
          problems.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>26-Oct-2002

        <ul>
          <li>The "Apple" checkbox was sometimes (incorrectly)
          invisible in the Generate Font/Family dialogs</li>

          <li>Minor improvements to the "Insert Character" dialog
          (to match <a href="http://umap.sf.net/">umap</a>)</li>

          <li>Minor tweak to text fields</li>

          <li>More configuration changes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>25-Oct-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Problems when reading an sfd with references to
          cleaned up characters.</li>

          <li>Removed code from ttf generation that check for
          points of inflection (but fixed a couple of bugs in it
          before doing that).</li>

          <li>Change the way scripting GenerateFamily behaves. One
          person has already been unable to figure out how to use
          it, and I agree that it didn't make much sense the way I
          had it.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>24-Oct-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Change the default configuration process to use
          dynamic libaries

            <ul>
              <li>Added "configure.static" which will configure for
              static libaries (On Mac OS/X the compiler gets
              internal compiler errors if asked to generate pic
              code)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Enable reading a straight ttf file out of a .bin or
          .hqx wrapper (ie. doesn't need to be in a resource
          fork)</li>

          <li>The Kern Pairs dlg did not show Hebrew/Arabic right
          to left. Fixed</li>

          <li>Added a popup menu to Kern Pairs which will allow you
          to reset a kern pair</li>

          <li>Added a way to configure the font family used for
          info messages in the outline and bitmap character
          views.</li>

          <li>New man pages which use the macros supported by Sun.
          Thanks to R. P. Channing Rodgers.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>22-Oct-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Initial version of Mac Family (FOND) generation</li>

          <li>Fix old sfds so that their bad pngs will become
          bitmaps</li>

          <li>optimize the fix to draw magnified.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>21-Oct-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Verbose addition to scripting broke loops</li>

          <li>Various changes to make utf8/ucs2 selections work
          properly with other programs</li>

          <li>Hebrew/Arabic drag and drop could cause crashes</li>

          <li>The Increment right side bearing command
          (Metrics-&gt;Set RBearing) set the width to the value
          rather than incrementing by that value.</li>

          <li>Fixes for the local encoding being utf8</li>

          <li>Imported bitmap pngs still were seen as indexed</li>

          <li>Problems drawing magnified images when the scale
          factor was 100%</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>20-Oct-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Updated French and Japanese UI translations</li>

          <li>Use LC_CTYPE (rather than LC_MESSAGES) to determine
          the current local encoding</li>

          <li>If the width line were selected then FontForge would
          sometimes snap cursor movements to an arbitrary x-value
          (often the axis)</li>

          <li>KANOU provided a patch which fixes some remove
          overlap problems.</li>

          <li>I had broken the generation of pure bitmap sfnts from
          scripts (7-Sept)</li>

          <li>Added a verbose mode to scripts (prints script to
          stdout as it is executed).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>18-Oct-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Tweaked metrics view so that null kerning now
          displays as an empty string rather than "0"</li>

          <li>If a font contained a kerning pair to a character
          that was omitted when saving the sfd file, then loading
          that font would leave it in a bad state and eventually
          cause a crash. Fixed on both ends (don't generate bad
          sfds any more, and can deal with them properly when
          found)</li>

          <li>Improved the "Insert Character" dialog a bit.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>17-Oct-2002

        <ul>
          <li>More work on Ik format files</li>

          <li>Redid UI for Auto Width/Kern to make it easier for
          cyrillic/greek users to kern their alphabets.</li>

          <li>Changed so that CJK encodings will attempt to map
          directly to a CJK font (rather than going through
          unicode) when displaying in the fontview.</li>

          <li>Added a command to join paths</li>

          <li>KANOU points out that support for mimetype cut/paste
          (11-Sept) broke cut/paste in scripting.</li>

          <li>KANOU supplied a patch for the knife tool.</li>

          <li>KANOU points out that IsVisible didn't work properly
          if passed a NULL point (it should never be passed a NULL
          pointer, but if it is no reason not to work
          correctly).</li>

          <li>KANOU points out that the UniqueID for ttf files used
          a bad date.</li>

          <li>Had the wrong MS language ID for hungarian</li>

          <li>Some of Luc Devroye's fonts contain a "div" in the
          FontMatrix. ATM doesn't support this, but it is easy
          enough to accept. Still don't support a full expression
          there, just a div.</li>

          <li>If we read in a gsf font and then generated
          postscript from that, we weren't able to read in the
          result.</li>

          <li>Added an empty glyph-encoding sub-table to mac
          FONDs</li>

          <li>Save multiple postscript did not save the first
          sub-font</li>

          <li>The second count in BeginChars could be wrong in an
          sfd file (FontForge doesn't care, but I suppose some
          program might).</li>

          <li>Add support for local encoding being UTF-8. Prefs now
          has an option to try and figure out the encoding from the
          locale</li>

          <li>Display filenames in the local encoding.</li>

          <li>There was an erroneous test in simplify which caused
          FontForge to complain about an internal error when in
          truth all was well.</li>

          <li>There was a bad test in dumpbdf</li>

          <li>Export will now allow the user to generate png files
          (if s/he's got the png libraries)</li>

          <li>It is possible to invoke Export from a script</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>11-Sept-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Added a menu in textfields (right mouse button)</li>

          <li>Added support for STRING_UTF8 selections</li>

          <li>Added support for "image/png", "image/bmp",
          "image/eps", "text/plain;charset=ISO-10646-UCS-2",
          "text/plain;charset=UTF-8"

            <ul>
              <li>(two image format)</li>

              <li>(one format for reading spline data)</li>

              <li>(two more ways of expressing unicode text
              data)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>10-Sept-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Added support for UTF8 in display/print dlg
          imports.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>9-Sept-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Added support for loading Ikarus .IK font files</li>

          <li>Fixed a divide by zero problem when generating
          ttfs</li>

          <li>If you type into the Kern Pairs dlg, it will now
          scroll to the pairs associated with the character you
          typed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>8-Sept-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Display crashed on systems without freetype</li>

          <li>my xfig reader didn't handle arcs</li>

          <li>Merge fonts and Interpolate fonts didn't
          merge/interpolate kerning pairs</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>7-Sept-2002

        <ul>
          <li>The ruler tool will give the length of a spline if
          applied between the spline's endpoints</li>

          <li>Made FontForge a little smarter about when to change
          the xuid field. <!--
          <LI>
          Added the tile path command.
          --></li>

          <li>Added a dlg to <a href="display.html">display
          fonts</a> using freetype.</li>

          <li>Added support for the obsolete _XFREE86_GLYPH_RANGES
          property and then turned it off by default.</li>

          <li>Improvements to type2 output.</li>

          <li>Changed greek accents to use 0x384 rather than 0x30d
          when substituting for 0x301</li>

          <li>I've found another case where Apple and MS/Adobe
          disagree on the format of ttf/otf files. So there's now a
          check box in the Generate dlg which allows you to select
          between the two defns. I've removed the two different
          kinds of bitmaps for ttf files, these are now controlled
          by this new checkbox too.</li>

          <li>FontForge would sometimes in otf files generate
          curves which should have been done as lines.</li>

          <li>macbinary resource output broke when I fixed straight
          resource output the other day.</li>

          <li>When a grid line was a line but expressed with
          control points, then fontforge would get very confused
          about how to snap to it.</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug in the generation of ttf/otf fonts with
          big5/sjis/wansung encodings.</li>

          <li>The ligature dlg had a bad habit of crashing.</li>

          <li>On the Mac, Obliqued fonts are stored in a weird
          postscript format. Try to support them</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>2-Sept-2002

        <ul>
          <li>When in no-x mode, fontforge did not notice any
          arguments (except -script). It will now notice -version,
          -usage and -help.</li>

          <li>The PS Names check box would be visible when
          generating otf fonts. It should not have been.</li>

          <li>If a font contained multiple encodings for the same
          character, then generating an otf font from it would
          crash fontforge.</li>

          <li>There is now a proper french translation of the ui
          (Merci Pierre Hanser!)</li>

          <li>Under cygwin, FontForge would fail to find internet
          explorer/netscape (because not in user's path) and if it
          did find them would try to invoke them with a cygwin
          style name (ie.
          /usr/local/share/doc/fontforge/overview.html rather than
          c:\cygwin\usr/local/share/doc/fontforge/overview.html
          )</li>

          <li>Added a preference item to allow you to control
          whether a mapping file from glyph ids to character names
          is produced along with ttf and otf fonts.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>1-Sept-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Added an #ifdef to an include file to make it work
          when built without X11</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>31-August-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Making a font be a cid-keyed font might screw up all
          other fontviews and lead to crashes.</li>

          <li>type1 cid keyed fonts got the wrong fontmatrix if the
          em-size was something other than 1000. Doesn't seem to
          make a difference though, we still get bad output for
          emsize!=1000</li>

          <li>got maxp.numGlyphs wrong for otf cid-keyed fonts
          which lacked a .notdef character</li>

          <li>Added a check to make sure fontnames are less than 63
          characters. Needed for ATM.</li>

          <li>format 2 Coverage tables (used by GPOS and GSUB
          tables (kerning &amp; ligatures for otf)) were being
          generated incorrectly. This meant that windows would
          refuse to read my otf files which had complex kerning.
          (presumably complex ligs, but I had no test cases). The
          mac printer driver has also had problems with my otf
          files. This may be why.</li>

          <li>Added a popup to the kern pair dlg to tell user how
          many kern pairs there are, and how many characters start
          kern pairs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>29-August-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Merge and Elide were backwards

            <ul>
              <li>And merge (simplify) had problems when a desired
              spline at the same slope at the start and end (or
              something like that).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Added a field to Review Hints showing the total
          number of hints, flag for h/vstem3, ability to move
          points associated with hint when moving hint. also added
          a hot key for it.</li>

          <li>Added a Find Problem to detect things which are
          almost but not quite h/vstem3</li>

          <li>AutoHint wasn't finding all the ghost hints it should
          have.</li>

          <li>Put in (what I hope is) a better way of detecting
          extraneous hints (the hypen case. At first sight the
          hstem and vstem appear equally valid) remove hints which
          are wider than they are long.</li>

          <li>More fixes from KANOU for cid fonts</li>

          <li>The scale to em checkbox only (sort of) worked if the
          emsize increased. Fix from KANOU</li>

          <li>Autohint could go into an infinite loop on characters
          containing a 0-length spline.</li>

          <li>Problem with cff name table fix of 27-Aug</li>

          <li>bdf fonts were loaded into background by default</li>

          <li>Scripting problem loading bitmap fonts into
          background.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>27-August-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Further attempts to fix the fact that FontForge in
          some ways does not believe that monospaced ttf files are
          monospaced.</li>

          <li>Problems with endif</li>

          <li>Redid the Find Problems dialog by adding tabs so that
          related problems are grouped together.</li>

          <li>Added a problem which will report advance widths
          which do not match some standard value.</li>

          <li>CID keyed generation was broken again by the (failed)
          attempt to make things work with FontLab (18-Aug)</li>

          <li>cff name table could be off by 1 if there were a real
          notdef character</li>

          <li>Added ability to display blue zones in outline
          view.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>21-August-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Broke cid-keyed otf generation on 27 July when I
          enabled the [Stop] button. Fix by KANOU.</li>

          <li>Bringing up progress indicator early (20 August)
          broke scripting without X11.</li>

          <li>Added ability to load a font protected by fstype=2 to
          a scripting (extra argument to open).</li>

          <li>Enhanced print abilities.</li>

          <li>Added ability to Print to scripting.</li>

          <li>Attempt to fix the fact that windows doesn't
          recognize my monospaced ttf fonts as monospace.</li>

          <li>FontForge could be confused by strange values of
          Ascent in the hhea table</li>

          <li>Added a Round to Int option to the transform
          dialogs</li>

          <li>Added ability to change the em-size (and rescale the
          font) to fontinfo</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>20-August-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Under KDE my tools palettes are made too wide and
          without borders. That's ok until they get reparented
          (docked). Added code in the docking routines to fix these
          problems.</li>

          <li>May have fixed a race condition problem due to
          reparented windows under freebsd.</li>

          <li>TeX sfd files are a little more complicated than I
          had originally thought, the parser is now more
          general.</li>

          <li>FontForge sometimes thought some X fonts had
          iso8859-1 encoding when they did not.</li>

          <li>cleaned up some problems with encodings</li>

          <li>Added support for TeX (actually MetaFont) gf
          files</li>

          <li>RLE background images sometimes showed up inverted
          (with background color as foreground &amp; vice
          versa)</li>

          <li>The Fit in window command should now take docked
          palettes into consideration.</li>

          <li>Added a Japanese translation of the UI, courtesy of
          KANOU Hiroki.</li>

          <li>Added the ability to run <code>mf</code> on a .mf
          font, generate a gf file, autotrace the gf file, and
          leave you with a font based on an mf file.</li>

          <li>Menus now do pointer grabs.</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug in generating PostScript resource file
          fonts on Mac OS/X</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>18-August-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Added a dlg to show all kern pairs (and another to
          show all ligatures)</li>

          <li>Added a "Find Problems" item to check for missing
          bitmaps.</li>

          <li>Put in some warnings to the ttf parser for bad cmap
          and glyf tables</li>

          <li>FontForge was still having trouble about loading
          space bitmaps (that had been generated with
          freetype).</li>

          <li>FontForge did not set the flag indicating manual
          hinting after changes by Review Hints or Create Hint.
          Should be set now.</li>

          <li>Various small tweaks to the pfa/pfb output because
          FontLab doesn't like what we currently do. Probably none
          will make much difference.</li>

          <li>The Print command would attempt to print characters
          outside the encoding of type1 fonts. This did not work
          well.</li>

          <li>The autowidth command got very confused when given a
          sans-serif script to autowidth when the Latin characters
          in the font were serifed.</li>

          <li>The Print sample text is now ordered so that the
          language specified in the LANG environment variable comes
          first in the list.</li>

          <li>Added $version</li>

          <li>FontForge will now read scripts from stdin if you
          follow the "-script" argument with "-".</li>

          <li>Valek points out the using CharInfo to change a
          character's color did not change it until the fontview
          was refreshed</li>

          <li>Expand Stroke had problems when intersections bent
          the wrong way.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>9-August-2002

        <ul>
          <li>I've decided to encourage use of the <a href=
          "index.html#Mail">mailing lists</a> for reporting bugs. A
          feeble attempt to cut down on the spam I get by removing
          my e-mail address from the site.</li>

          <li>Bug in the dlg asking for the resolution of a bdf
          font. The second (and subsequent) time(s) it came up it
          would have a good chance of never going away again, and
          potentially crashing FontForge into the bargain. (number
          of other bugs here too)</li>

          <li>If the postscript "FontName" contained a hyphen then
          any generated BDF fonts would have invalid X fontnames
          (they hyphen would be included which would throw the name
          parsing off by one hyphen).</li>

          <li>Greg Ford points out that generating a bdf font and
          then loading it back in will often change the fontname.
          This is because the fontname is not actually stored in
          bdf files. I've added a FONT_NAME property to the bdf
          fonts I generate.</li>

          <li>FontForge would sometimes forget about the first
          bitmap character in each bitmap font stored in an sfd
          file. <span class="c1"><strong><big>Please check any sfd
          files to see if they are missing bitmaps of space,
          exclamation point, etc.</big></strong></span> Probably
          introduced 11-June.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>8-Aug-2002

        <ul>
          <li>After yesterday's fix textfields ignored
          backspaces</li>

          <li>More work on the metrics lines. There's now a dlg to
          control which ones get drawn.</li>

          <li>FontInfo would sometimes crash after adding ttf
          names.</li>

          <li>Added minimal ability to dock palettes into their
          respective views.</li>

          <li>Added a way of looking at the fontview where there
          are now holes in the font (ie. a compacted view where
          every cell contains a glyph). This is just another
          encoding, but people have been asking for it and it is
          slightly easier to get to than normal reencoding of a
          font. Note: It has no defined relationship to the glyph
          array in a ttf file.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>7-Aug-2002

        <ul>
          <li>The 21-July autowidth/kern change broke
          autowidth/kern scripting.</li>

          <li>And the serif detection failed if the character I did
          not reach the baseline.</li>

          <li>FontForge read RGB png files incorrectly.</li>

          <li>FontForge used to bring up most dialogs underneath
          the cursor. Now it only does that if the focus is set to
          FocusFollowsMouse, and otherwise centers dlgs.</li>

          <li>FontForge now will draw metrics lines in the fontview
          if you want it to.</li>

          <li>FontForge remembers what outline character views were
          open when a font was saved (as an sfd file) and will
          automagically reopen them when you next load that
          font.</li>

          <li>Added <code>View-&gt;Find In Font View</code> command
          to the outline character view. Will scroll the fontview
          to display the current character.</li>

          <li>Textfields within FontForge ignored the numeric
          keypad</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>4-Aug-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Yesterday's resize fix didn't quite work</li>

          <li>Try to improve conversion of cubic to quadratic
          spline (actually, we make the conversion worse, but it
          probably helps rasterizers not to have points quite so
          close together).</li>

          <li>Some more work on the TTF style name</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>3-Aug-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Failed to read ttf fontnames properly for some dfonts
          (probably some ttc files as well)</li>

          <li>Didn't position references by point matching properly
          (when loading from ttf)</li>

          <li>removed some debugging code inadvertently left in
          after the rle fix.</li>

          <li>Added support for <a href="xim.html">X Input
          Methods</a> (to do CJK character input properly)<br />
          This only works if X_HAVE_UTF8_STRING is defined -- an
          XFree 4.0.2 extension (ie. not on solaris)</li>

          <li>Added a possible fix to a resizing problem for some
          window managers.</li>

          <li>Added CIDFlattenByCMap function to scripting.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>30-July-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a couple of problems found by <a href=
          "http://developer.kde.org/~sewardj/">valgrind</a></li>

          <li>Applied a patch from KANOU Hiroki. PasteInto did not
          work.</li>

          <li>Added run length encoding compression to sfd files
          (for background images). Bitmap image sizes are much
          smaller now.</li>

          <li>FontForge failed to recognize that a PNG black and
          white image was monochrome.</li>

          <li>Now FontForge will immediately put up the progress
          indicator when loading the first font (so the user has
          something to look at)</li>

          <li>A little more work on generate multiple.</li>

          <li>Removed a confusing message about autohinting a font
          for which no autohinting was actually done (it was just
          checking to see if it needed to).</li>

          <li>Oops. Windows won't accept a ttf file if there is no
          name table entry with the same platform/specific entries
          as those in the cmap.</li>

          <li>If a character contained a reference to a blank
          character that FontForge decided wasn't worth outputting,
          then the truetype composite for it would not work.</li>

          <li>The standard format for the ttf "version" name is
          different from the equivalent postscript name. Added code
          to interconvert between the two rather than expecting
          them to be the same.</li>

          <li>Added a gasp table for when there was no
          hinting.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>28-July-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Pressing the [Filter] button on a blank field will
          show the current filter text (holding the mouse over the
          [Filter] button will cause a popup to appear with the
          same info).</li>

          <li>If there were know selection the pressing an arrow
          key would presume that the selection was at encoding -1,
          which caused strange behavior. Now we will pretend that
          the selection is visible and halfway down the
          screen.</li>

          <li>Oops. CMap files allow for multiple encodings for the
          same glyph. Now prepared to put in refs.</li>

          <li>Oops. Generate multiple had several problems
          (couldn't handle encodings above 0x80000000, was
          surprised by empty font numbers, etc.)</li>

          <li>If a family name contained a space then only the
          first word in it would be read out of an sfd file</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>27-July-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Oops. I was calling TeX sfd files Sub Font
          Directories and their proper name was Sub Font
          Definition.</li>

          <li>Enabled the [Stop] button in the progress dlg when
          saving a font.</li>

          <li>FontForge would go into an infinite loop when reading
          one of its sfd files when it was expecting a TeX sfd
          file. Fixed, and put in guards so that won't happen
          anyway.</li>

          <li>Added two new menu commands "Flatten to CMap" and
          "Convert By CMap". These will use one of Adobe's CMap
          files to guide the Flattening/Converting process (rather
          than one of my cidmap files)</li>

          <li>Added support for some really large encodings if they
          have almost equally large gaps in them (use adobe's
          "coderange" data to manage a sparce array).</li>

          <li>If we could not find any style modifiers in a
          fontname, then we used to claim that the style was
          "Regular". I think it is better if we claim that it is
          /Width (ie. whatever is in the FontInfo /Width entry) and
          if that isn't set then return "Regular")</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>26-July-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Added support for Werner's (TeX's) Sub Font
          Definition files which provide a way of splitting up a 2
          byte encoding into lots of little pfb fonts with 256
          characters in each.</li>

          <li>Normally in a ttf font, FontForge generates a 'post'
          table with the names of all the characters in it. I've
          just added a way to make it generate a short 'post' table
          with no character names.</li>

          <li>FontForge generates bad truetype hints. There is now
          a way to turn these off in the Generate Font dlg.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>24-July-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Code for finding the style still not working as it
          should.</li>

          <li>Oops, the postscript parser was over-zealous about
          generating warnings.</li>

          <li>Oops, the code which interprets results from
          autotrace was over-zealous on getting rid of contours in
          small images.
            <hr />
          </li>

          <li>SetUnicodeValue did not behave as it should
          have.</li>

          <li>Made acorn2sfd a little sturdier.
            <hr />
          </li>

          <li>Bitmap copies didn't work from the font view
          (probably broke when I added anti-aliased support)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>23-July-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Crash bug introduced yesterday by the duplicate name
          work.</li>

          <li>Initial version of <i><a href=
          "acorn2sfd.html">acorn2sfd</a></i> -- a program to
          convert Acorn RISC/OS font directories into sfd
          files.</li>

          <li>If a font is loaded from a ttf file, then it will
          have both postscript and ttf versions of certain names
          stored (family, copyright, version, etc.). The postscript
          names are obviously displayed, but changing them would
          not change the ttf versions. So generating a ttf font and
          then looking at it would still show the old setting of
          the name. The two should be better synchronized now.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>22-July-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Introduced a crash yesterday if a postscript font
          contained an name in an encoding vector which was not
          defined in the font.
            <hr />
          </li>

          <li>More work on duplicate names. I no longer append a
          ".&lt;number&gt;" to the end of duplicate entries and
          when generating fonts I remove them and generate an
          encoding with has multiple references to the base glyph.
          Which is what I should have been doing.</li>

          <li>Small improvements to the style name detector.</li>

          <li>If the Width field was a null string, then reading it
          from an sfd file caused us to thing the next keyword was
          the width.</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug in the display of menus.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>21-July-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Various small bugs in build accented characters</li>

          <li>On the mac the filenames for mac resource fonts are
          different from same fonts elsewhere (elsewhere they have
          an additional ".bin"). Made either extension work from a
          script file (so they can work cross platform).</li>

          <li>Expand Stroke had problems with curved splines where
          the slope at one of the end-points was 0/0. Since this
          will happen by default when joining a corner point to a
          curved point this should have been a frequent
          occurrence.</li>

          <li>Bug in generating 'post' table if glyph 0 existed but
          was not .notdef.</li>

          <li>PostScript fonts with one glyph going to multiple
          encodings cause problems.</li>

          <li>Now both PS and TTF load will have consistent names
          in the above case.</li>

          <li>My presumption of how symbol encodings were stored
          under MicroSoft was wrong. It is not a one byte encoding,
          it is a map into the private/corporate use area of
          unicode. 0xf000-0xf0ff. Changed to deal with that.</li>

          <li>Loading a font with mac roman encoding often
          generated a font of 65536 characters (rather than 256+a
          few extras). Fixed.</li>

          <li>New version of autowidth/kern. I don't think it kerns
          serifed fonts well, might do ok for sans.</li>

          <li>Ability to provide autokern with a list of potential
          kern pairs and have it just check them.
            <hr />
          </li>

          <li>Scripting support for kernpair files</li>

          <li>AutoWidth/Kern now does a little better on serifed
          fonts</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>15-July-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Correct Direction should now only set the changed bit
          when it actually changes a character.</li>

          <li>Correct Direction will now warn about flipped
          references, and offer you the chance to unlink them
          (after which it will be able to correct their
          direction)</li>

          <li>Added ability to scripting to check if a character
          has changed, and to get a font's filename.</li>

          <li>Cleaned up build accented chars a bit.</li>

          <li>Another attempt to keep X from crashing on
          disappearing progress dlgs.</li>

          <li>Maximizing the fontview could make it bigger than the
          screen so that the scroll bar was unusable.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>14-July-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Valek points out that bitmaps generated by freetype
          were one pixel too high.</li>

          <li>Changed the get info dlg for references so that the
          user could change the transformation matrix.</li>

          <li>Font Info-&gt;PS Private got the wrong value when
          guessing the vertical stem snaps</li>

          <li>FontForge did not find ghost hints for things at the
          numeric height.</li>

          <li>FontForge got non-integer values for some hints where
          it should have found integer values.</li>

          <li>Bug when auto-hinting references fixed.</li>

          <li>FontForge would find hints for things that don't need
          to be hinted (finding a vertical stem for the top of "E"
          for instance. There is a vertical stem there, but it is
          deemed irrelevant). It now finds fewer of these hints. I
          hope it still finds all the legitimate ones.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>13-July-2002

        <ul>
          <li>I think I've finally worked out Apple's scaled offset
          <a href="Composites/index.html">composite</a> glyphs (and
          they do not behave as Apple documents)</li>

          <li>FontForge was not setting the maxCompositePoints and
          maxCompositeContours fields of the maxp table of truetype
          fonts. This meant that in some cases rasterizers would
          crash when trying to deal with characters containing many
          components.</li>

          <li>The translation tables between unicode and johab were
          wrong.</li>

          <li>FontForge failed to generate ttf fonts with
          big5/sjis/wansung cmaps.</li>

          <li>Changed so that reading sjis/wansung encoded ttf
          files would use a sjis/wansung encoding in fontforge
          (rather than the 94x94 encoding that no one but me seems
          to understand).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>9-July-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Bug in generating ttf fonts with embedded
          bitmaps.</li>

          <li>Open Font dlg will now try again if it can't load a
          valid font.</li>

          <li>Started working on a <a href=
          "http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.cgi/fontforge/fontforge/test/">
            minimal testsuite</a>, and what do you know? I found
            some bugs...

            <ul>
              <li>Scripting had problems when user preference was
              set to ask for bdf resolution.</li>

              <li>Generate() scripting built in now takes an
              optional resolution argument</li>

              <li>Problems generating the vertical metrics tables
              in cid keyed otf fonts</li>

              <li>Problems working with cid-keyed fonts in scripts
              if fontforge could not find the requisite cidmap file
                <hr />
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Fixed various problems with parsing EPS files, and
          extended the vocabulary a little.</li>

          <li>If the ".notdef" character was whitespace (as it is
          for most postscript fonts) then generating a ttf font
          would produce an entry for glyph 0 that both flint and NT
          consider to be erroneous, while freetype and windows
          think it's fine. Fixed so that Flint no longer
          complains.</li>

          <li>the fontview could get confused about matching short
          names with periods in them against the standard
          postscript unicode names, so it could think that "b.0"
          matched "bracketleft". This caused some confusion in the
          display.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>27-June-2002

        <ul>
          <li>A couple more vms patches</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>26-June-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Merged in Jouk Jansen changes for OpenVMS</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>23-June-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Valek wanted to be able to add comments to characters
          and to flag characters with some visible mark. The
          <a href="charinfo.html#Character">Char Info</a> dlg has
          been extended to do this. The scripting language has been
          extended to allow scripts to set and test these too.</li>

          <li>Added a "foreach selected character in the font"
          loop.</li>

          <li>Added $selection variable to return the current
          selection as an array</li>

          <li>Extended the Select() and SelectMore() commands to
          accept an array as an argument (and set the selection to
          the array).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>22-June-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Yesterday's unicode sprintf change introduced another
          bug. Fixed</li>

          <li>Valek points out that if you have a bitmap only font
          and you attempt simultaneously to scale it and delete all
          the bitmaps, then FontForge would crash. (Same thing
          would happen if you just removed all the bitmaps).</li>

          <li>Valek provided some additional russian
          translations.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>21-June-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Ttf fonts seem to be unhappy if they contain a glyph
          with a single contour and a single point on that contour.
          I don't know why. Output all such as spaces.</li>

          <li>Added ability to set the resolution of a bdf
          font.</li>

          <li>Rearranged preferences.</li>

          <li>Added scripting access to Force-Encoding</li>

          <li>FontForge memory allocation optimizations didn't work
          if sizeof(int *)==8</li>

          <li>Bug in unicode sprintf routine when
          sizeof(long)==8</li>

          <li>In some cases when reading a ttf font with a
          (unicode) cmap which assigned one glyph to two encodings,
          and if that glyph happened to be in the
          AdobeStandardEncoding, then when converting to Type1
          FontForge would create a dictionary which recursively
          seac-ed (invoked) itself. This caused an infinite loop in
          GhostView, and crashed some printers.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>11-June-2002

        <ul>
          <li>CID fix on 3 June was wrong, it broke all non-CID
          keyed postscript fonts (it did work for CID fonts). Both
          should work now.</li>

          <li>Added better support for bdf foundries and for bdf
          copyrights.</li>

          <li>Added a preference item to specify the ttf VendorID
          (foundry). Used to truncate the bdf foundry to 4
          characters.</li>

          <li>Small bug fix in print</li>

          <li>Cleaned up bug in scripting ($bitmaps)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>7-June-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed some more CID font problems</li>

          <li>Tweaked behavior of FamilyName/FullName in
          GetFontInfo dlg.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>6-June-2002

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge now supports greymap strikes in truetype
          files</li>

          <li>The bitmap editor has been extended to handle greymap
          (anti-aliased) fonts</li>

          <li>There is no longer a separate mechanism for
          generating greymap files from the Generate Font dlg,
          instead they may be added to the font database file with
          the bitmap dlg.</li>

          <li>Added support for vertical metrics in bdf files.</li>

          <li>Fixed some problems in moving the vwidth line in
          outline character views</li>

          <li>Added some default window positioning code.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>4-June-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Oops, more bug fixes for the new greymap format.</li>

          <li>One more attempt to solve the X Server bug where
          destroying/unmapping a window before its map notify event
          gets processed causes the X server to crash.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>3-June-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Stopped using my extension to bdf to make it support
          greymaps and started using that supported by freetype
          (removed the BITSPERPIXEL keyword and added an extra
          argument to the SIZE keyword).</li>

          <li>More fixes for cid fonts</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>18-May-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Font Info will prompt user about changing the
          UniqueID/XUID if the font name is changed without
          changing them.</li>

          <li>Fixed some Mac configuration problems.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>16-May-2002

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge would not compile when trying to used
          libjpeg as a static library (as on Mac OS/X)</li>

          <li>Use psili rather than koronis where appropriate</li>

          <li>It was not possible to select the ellipse/star tool
          from the tools palette.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>14-May-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Made fontforge work without X (ie. the scripting
          engine can be linked without requiring that X be present.
          Possibly useful for Mac OS/X, Cygwin)
            <hr />
          </li>

          <li>When showing what a greek accented character will be
          built from, the character info dlg will now show the
          non-unicode alternate whether or not the characters
          needed exist in the font.</li>

          <li>The Reference Info dlg will now include the unicode
          value of the referenced character</li>

          <li>The positioning of ypogegrammeni with respect to eta
          was broken (again)</li>

          <li>Some more greek fixes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>13-May-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Various fixes for greek accented characters</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>7-May-2002

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge would crash when attempting to Flatten a
          CID keyed font (introduced 16-Apr with the multiple
          fontview support)</li>

          <li>FontForge did not process panose information
          correctly (broken 21-Jan, comment change)</li>

          <li>FontForge did not create new ttf names properly when
          they were for a language which had not been used before
          in the font.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>6-May-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Oops. Adobe describes two naming conventions for
          ligatures and I only supported one of them. I should
          support the other one now.</li>

          <li>Fixed a number of bugs caused by custom
          encodings.</li>

          <li>If the selection in the font view contained either
          "dotlessi" or "dotlessj" and the Element menu was pulled
          down then the dotless characters would be created from
          their dotted variants (you didn't even have to select
          anything from the menu) (broken 24-Feb-2002)</li>

          <li>FontForge had trouble reading non-empty ttf glyphs
          with 0 contours.</li>

          <li>FontForge failed to read images from an sfd file
          without a transparent colour</li>

          <li>Allow parens in familyname in the fontinfo dlg.</li>

          <li>When the width was selected, depressing a mouse
          button would snap the logical pointer location to a
          random x coordinate (often 0).</li>

          <li>When generating a ttf file from a subfont of a CID
          keyed font fontforge would crash. This has been
          fixed.</li>

          <li>When exiting with multiple font views looking at one
          (changed) font, there would be no prompt to save the
          font.</li>

          <li>Added a <a href="search.html">Find/Replace</a>
          feature</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>16-Apr-2002

        <ul>
          <li>BDF fonts did not mark the missing (.notdef,
          undefined, etc.) character properly.</li>

          <li>otf fonts had the default and normative widths
          reversed on output</li>

          <li>Added marginally better support for non-latin
          ligatures in GPOS/GSUB tables.</li>

          <li>Added support for arabic forms in the GSUB table (ie.
          we now produce 'init', 'medi', 'fina', and 'isol'
          features)</li>

          <li>Build composite should now note whether arabic
          ligatures are &lt;initial&gt;, &lt;final&gt;,
          &lt;medial&gt; or &lt;isolated&gt;</li>

          <li>It is now possible to have multiple font views
          looking at one font. I expect this will be a rich source
          of bugs, especially for CID keyed fonts.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>9-Apr-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Under KDE we could get two textfields flashing
          cursors (thinking they had focus) should be fixed.</li>

          <li>Added Undo/Redo to metricsview</li>

          <li>Added Undo/Redo to fontview</li>

          <li>Added Element menu to metricsview</li>

          <li>Added [Fix] button to (some of) Find Problems</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>5-Apr-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Applied various patches from KANOU Hiroki</li>

          <li>Changes to metricsview

            <ul>
              <li>Fixed some minor bugs</li>

              <li>Double clicking on a character will open that
              character</li>

              <li>Enabled Copy/(CopyRef/CopyWidth/)Paste but not
              Cut</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>FontForge had problems when there were exactly two X
          resources.</li>

          <li>Made the Point Info dlg wider.</li>

          <li>Improved printing text samples at large point
          sizes.</li>

          <li>I was generating flex hints incorrectly.</li>

          <li>Extended postscript interpreter slightly to recognize
          the eps files (called "art") produced by
          fontographer</li>

          <li>Additions to the scripting language

            <ul>
              <li>CenterInWidth</li>

              <li>AutoWidth (from Andreas Påhlsson)</li>

              <li>AutoKern</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>The Expand Stroke fix for 4-Mar-2001 was too
          extreme.</li>

          <li>Added a field to Char Info that shows the components
          out of which this character (accented, ligature, hangul
          syllable, etc.) may be built.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>3-Apr-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Various scrollbar enhancements

            <ul>
              <li>thumb now has a bigger minimum size</li>

              <li>fontview/charview both respond to page up and
              page down requests</li>

              <li>right mouse button may be used to position
              thumb</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Installed James A. Crippen makefile patch so that
          distclean reports success even if there are no files to
          clean.</li>

          <li>FontForge had problems guessing default ligatures for
          characters outside of BMP.</li>

          <li>In the outline character view, double clicking with
          one of the point tools (curve, corner, tangent, pen) will
          add a point and then bring up a <a href=
          "getinfo.html">Point Info</a> dialog</li>

          <li>If you edit in a textfield (so that the mouse pointer
          vanishes) and then tabbed into another text field the
          mouse pointer would never reappear.</li>

          <li>Merge Fonts left memory in a bad state and would
          often cause a crash.</li>

          <li>Merge Fonts used a string for a title which was ascii
          when unicode was expected. This could cause strange
          characters to be displayed.</li>

          <li>More fixes for build accented characters (for
          inverted breve and Oslash).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>14-Mar-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Nifty. The modifier keys auto-repeat under cygwin (if
          Control is down one gets a series of Press/Release,
          Press/Release... while normal X just gives one Press.)
          This meant we'd keep refreshing the tools palette, which
          meant an annoying flicker and slowed things down.</li>

          <li>Raise the palettes after a resize</li>

          <li>FontForge didn't handle 8bit colormaps well. I've
          improved the behavior, and added an x resource to give
          the user some control over behavior.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>10-Mar-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Oops. I broke CID-keyed postscript input (ie.
          none-otf) when I added the 6-Mar fix for type1utils</li>

          <li>Applied another patch from KANOU Hiroki, on otf cid
          support</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>9-Mar-2002

        <ul>
          <li>added docs for sfddiff.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>8-Mar-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Added a new program, <a href=
          "sfddiff.html">sfddiff</a>, to compare fonts and show
          their differences.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>6-Mar-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Small change to the format of cidmap files (to bring
          names into conformance with adobe's spec on modified
          unicode names), and corresponding changes to a few
          routines.</li>

          <li>Add support for the type1 format produced by GNU
          type1utils. Which is vaguely like that used by
          ghostview.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>4-Mar-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed more problems with reading eps files (these
          were mostly within Expand Stroke, so presumably also
          problems with Element-&gt;Expand Stroke)</li>

          <li>And one more problem with the file chooser.</li>

          <li>Scripting additions:

            <ul>
              <li>Ability to generate a pfm file from script</li>

              <li>Ability to Merge Kerning Info from a script</li>

              <li>Ability to Remove All Kerning info from a
              script</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <hr />
            Will now display something useful for rotated and
            italic cids
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>3-Mar-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a number of problems involved in reading in eps
          files.</li>

          <li>28-Feb Mac work introduced a bug in the file picker
          dlg (in wildcarding).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>2-Mar-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Rounding errors could accumulate when generating
          Type1 fonts.</li>

          <li>Fix for some overlap problems due to KANOU
          Hiroki</li>

          <li>If FontForge crashed (or was interrupted) after
          making some (unsaved) changes to a font, and that font
          was subsequently deleted, the FontForge's autorecovery
          would complain about a missing file each time it was
          started. Now it will notice the problem and ask whether
          it should delete the recovery file (whereupon it will
          stop complaining).</li>

          <li>Enabled a fix from Greg Ford so that FontForge set
          the mac style bits appropriately.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>28-Feb-2002

        <ul>
          <li>When running under Mac OS/X FontForge is now able to
          open/create mac resource forks</li>

          <li>I may have fixed a bug displaying images on solaris
          screens with bit depth 8</li>

          <li>Cleaned up a problem with the postscript name table
          (in a ttf file) when there was a .notdef character</li>

          <li>Fixed some problems with references when reading in
          truetype.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>24-Feb-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Substr() did not work when given three arguments</li>

          <li>Added

            <ul>
              <li>$bitmaps (returns an array of all bitmap sizes
              rasterized for the current font)</li>

              <li>BitmapsAvail()</li>

              <li>BitmapsRegen()</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Changed the FontInfo dlg to give direct access to the
          postscript names rather than trying to build the fontname
          out of family and modifiers.</li>

          <li>Added the ability to create an encoding which is any
          given plane of unicode (ie BMP is plane 0, SMP is plane
          1, SIP is plane 2...)</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug in Revert</li>

          <li>More work on hints.
            <hr />
          </li>

          <li>Build Composite will now build a dotlessi from an "i"
          (and same for dotlessj)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>20-Feb-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Made Shift-Arrow keys move along italic axis.</li>

          <li>$argv didn't work in scripting. (broken when I added
          arrays)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>19-Feb-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Bugs in the generation of MacRoman encoding tables in
          ttf output (introduced 14-Feb)</li>

          <li>The Goto Dlg sometimes didn't notice Returns (ie. OK
          button wasn't always invoked)</li>

          <li>Some linear splines were not noticed as such.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>18-Feb-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Cancelling the Point Info dlg would leave minimum
          distance hints in a bad state.</li>

          <li>Using Undo also left the MD hints wonky</li>

          <li>added $fontchanged to scripting</li>

          <li>Added SaveAll menu item in font view.</li>

          <li>Sometimes the underlines for accelerators didn't
          print in the menu (depended on what FontForge thought the
          screen resolution was).</li>

          <li>Added a new minimum distance hint for serifs of
          diagonal stems.</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug where some extra serif stems were
          hinted.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>16-Feb-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Created a "Select" submenu of the edit menu in the
          outline view. Moved Edit-&gt;Select All, View-&gt;Next
          Point, View-&gt;Prev Point into it.</li>

          <li>Added Deselect All, Select Next Control Point, Select
          Prev Control Point, Select First Point, Select Width,
          Select VWidth</li>

          <li>It is now possible to select the width (right
          bearing) line and move it with the arrow keys or
          transform dlg (or to move points and the width line
          concurrently). VWidth too.</li>

          <li>Added variables with global and font scope to
          Scripting.</li>

          <li>Yet another bug in the new simplify/merge code</li>

          <li>Cleaned up unicode range names a bit more.
            <hr />
          </li>

          <li>Changed the Goto Character dialog so that it will now
          (for two/four byte encodings) display a list of unicode
          ranges which are in the font and allow you to go to a
          range by name.</li>

          <li>Made it possible to copy and paste the left and right
          side bearings (from menus and scripts)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>14-Feb-2002

        <ul>
          <li>My TrueType parser will now read cmap subtable
          formats 8,10 and 12 (the 4 byte encoding tables) and will
          produce format 12 subtables for full unicode fonts.</li>

          <li>Cleaned up various encoding problems.</li>

          <li>Fixed display of SJIS.</li>

          <li>Added better commentary on unicode outside of
          BMP</li>

          <li>Cleaned up the spec file</li>

          <li>In pfb files subroutines for references didn't work
          if the first thing called was untranslated.</li>

          <li>The arrow keys can be used to move a control
          point.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>12-Feb-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Added sjis and Wansung encodings</li>

          <li>Used freetype for a couple of other things
          (generating gdf files and exporting bitmaps)</li>

          <li>Textfields didn't respond to middle button clicks (to
          paste the primary selection).</li>

          <li>FontForge would sometimes fail to exit properly if
          you brought up a script dlg.</li>

          <li>Added a --version command line option.</li>

          <li>Fixed another bug in generating postscript.</li>

          <li>Added a user defined print command option to the
          print dlg.</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug in Simplify/Merge</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug in loading integer resources</li>

          <li>Cleaned up the help command line option.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>9-Feb-2002

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge will now use freetype (if available) to
          generate bitmaps for the fonts (results are much
          better).<br />
          It still does its own rasterizing for the fontview
          (there's a lot of overhead involved with freetype, and
          this needs to be fastish)</li>

          <li>Made the Generate Font dlg settings sticky across
          invocations of fontforge.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>8-Feb-2002

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge would crash when generating a PostScript
          font from ARIAL.TTF.</li>

          <li>Changed the bitmap dlgs so that they allow you to
          specify some control over interesting screen resolutions.
          (before just support X standard res. of 75 and 100, now
          support MS 96&amp;120 and Mac 72).</li>

          <li>Oops, Apple now documents that the bdat and bloc
          tables should have version number 0x20000. But when I
          last looked it said 0x10000 and that didn't work.</li>

          <li>Put the docs in their own rpm file.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>7-Feb-2002

        <ul>
          <li>I think I've figured out how Apple does asian bitmaps
          now. They don't use NFNTs at all (or they do, but those
          NFNT are tiny stubs with no real data in them). All the
          data are in the sfnt. I should produce them properly
          now.<br />
          -- Except I don't.</li>

          <li>I've also added the ability to create bitmap only
          sfnts for the mac.<br />
          -- Which also isn't recognized by the mac.</li>

          <li>Made it possible for scripts to generate bitmaps
          without generating an outline font</li>

          <li>Fixed some problems loading bitmaps from ttf
          files.</li>

          <li>Fixed some problems loading bitmaps from
          anything...</li>

          <li>Allowed importation of eps files from the font view
          (to the extent that I can parse eps files, that is)</li>

          <li>Oops, scripting didn't support importation of pcf
          files.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>5-Feb-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Sometimes popup windows (tool tips) would show up
          with nothing in them. That should be fixed now.</li>

          <li>Added icons for pcf files</li>

          <li>Started work on 32 bit unicode.</li>

          <li>Oops. Scripting handled the calligraphic pen angle
          incorrectly.</li>

          <li>Put something into the about box.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>4-Feb-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Oops. FontForge was misusing the type1 "seac" command
          in some cases. I had not realized that the character
          being built needed to have the same width as the base
          (non-accent) character. This has been fixed.</li>

          <li>When using the charinfo dlg to change the name of a
          char, and that name was in use, and you cancelled the dlg
          after being warned about it then FontForge would crash
          (it would muck up memory).</li>

          <li>FontForge wasn't always calling subroutines (in
          postscript) when a character was in a subr.</li>

          <li>FontForge will now read in X11 pcf font files (they
          can be compressed, if so FontForge will decompress them
          first).</li>

          <li>Bug in wildcard processing for file chooser
          window.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>1-Feb-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Nifty! SUSE ships some greek (bitmap) fonts with
          iso8859-1 encodings rather than iso8859-7. FontForge is
          now alert and when it sees a bitmap font with foundary
          "greek" and encoding "iso8859-1" it will pretend it has
          encoding "iso8859-7".</li>

          <li>FontForge got confused by some fonts produced by
          type1fix.pl. Should be fixed.</li>

          <li>Build Composite Characters will now check the user
          defined ligature string to see what characters to use to
          build a ligature.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>31-Jan-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Conversion tables between JIS0201 (Katakana) and
          Unicode were wrong. KANOU Hiroki provided correct
          ones.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>30-Jan-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Oops. I'd left diagonal stems enabled in ttf
          generation. Caused problems. Disabled now.</li>

          <li>More work on accented characters.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>29-Jan-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Sped up background image drawing (finally)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>28-Jan-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Added

            <ul>
              <li>Strtol</li>

              <li>Strskipint</li>

              <li>AskUser</li>

              <li>Error</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Added a menu of commonly used scripts which the user
          can specify with the preference dlg.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>25-Jan-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Oops. Generate command in scripting language only
          generated pfb fonts</li>

          <li>FontForge would get confused if it loaded a font from
          a script when running with windows. Eventually it would
          crash, but perhaps not until you exited.</li>

          <li>Added

            <ul>
              <li>$italicangle</li>

              <li>$cidfontname, $cidfamilyname, $cidfullname</li>

              <li>$weight, $copyright</li>

              <li>$cidweight, $cidcopyright</li>

              <li>SetItalicAngle</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Removed $cidname (replaced with $cidfontname)</li>

          <li>Added a Call... button to the execute script dlg to
          allow you to insert a call to a script file easily</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>24-Jan-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Added a way to scale dlgs in different
          languages.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>23-Jan-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a crash in merge (caused by selecting all
          points on a path and merging it (to remove the
          path))</li>

          <li>Improved positioning of ogonek and cedilla accents in
          Build Accented Character</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>22-Jan-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Added:

            <ul>
              <li>SetCharCnt</li>

              <li>SetCharName</li>

              <li>SetUnicodeValue</li>

              <li>CIDChangeSubFont</li>

              <li>SetFontNames</li>

              <li>CIDSetFontNames</li>

              <li>$curcid, $nextcid, $firstcid, $cidname</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Cleaned up ligature handling in char info dlg</li>

          <li>Cleaned up array freeing in scripting.</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash in FontInfo introduced yesterday</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>21-Jan-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Import will now allow you to import background images
          from the font view<br />
          (and the default setting of "Background" for "pk" files
          has been set to true)</li>

          <li>Added a scripting command to access

            <ul>
              <li>Import</li>

              <li>strlen</li>

              <li>strstr</li>

              <li>strcasecmp</li>

              <li>strsub</li>

              <li>arrays</li>

              <li>access to the postscript names of the font</li>

              <li>access to information about individual
              characters</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Cleaned up some display oddities in the
          fontview.</li>

          <li>Added a Set Width command to the bitmap view IF there
          is no outline font.</li>

          <li>Added a menu item to invoke a script</li>

          <li>Added a "Comment" field to FontInfo. This does not
          correspond to any postscript or truetype entity. It is to
          be used for a changelog within the sfd file (or something
          similar).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>19-Jan-2002

        <ul>
          <li>Initial version of <a href=
          "scripting.html">scripting</a>.</li>

          <li>Optimizer caused rounding errors which caused test
          for divide by zero to fail leading to errors in Simplify
          and Merge commands.</li>

          <li>bdf fonts with an encoding which did not itself
          include "-1" (or similar) failed to get the implied "-0"
          added.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>17-Jan-2002

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge used to crash (sometimes anyway) if a list
          popup were active when a window was destroyed.</li>

          <li>TextFields within tabsets (like Font Info) responded
          to some events twice.</li>

          <li>Bug in the new TTF hinting routines could cause a
          crash (and did cause glyph programs which were
          erroneous)</li>

          <li>Crash caused by long names in /etc/passwd when
          creating a new font</li>

          <li>Redid fontname handling in Font Info dlg to allow URW
          names to pass through unscathed

            <ul>
              <li>Recognize "Regu" as meaning "Regular"</li>

              <li>Only updates the fullname (human readable name)
              if it were previously in sync</li>

              <li>Recognize "-" as starting the modifiers rather
              than trying to find the end of the family name</li>

              <li>If you don't change the family or the modifiers
              then fontforge will now leave the fontname
              untouched</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>14 Jan 2002

        <ul>
          <li>The 9 Jan metrics view fix caused crashes when
          changing the last character displayed.</li>

          <li>The outline view now will display points at extrema
          in a different color from other points if you want
          that.</li>

          <li>Added a command to the font view to clear out the
          backgrounds of all selected characters.</li>

          <li>Fixed one more image freeing problem (see
          29-Dec-2001)
            <hr />
          </li>

          <li>bdf fixes of 9&amp;11 Jan did not work on bdf files
          with character encodings of "-1"</li>

          <li>Fixed several bugs with ttf bitmap tables.</li>

          <li>Added a mechanism for specifying a font inside a
          truetype collection from the command line:<br />
          <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ fontforge
          "gulim.ttc(GulimChe)"</code><br />
          will load the GulimChe font within the collection
          file.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>12 Jan 2002

        <ul>
          <li>Russian ui had an unexpected space in it which
          confused makenomenh. Have fixed both (makenomenh &amp;
          nomen.ru)</li>

          <li>Last fix to Merge made most merges return straight
          lines</li>

          <li>Added an elide command which allows the slopes of the
          endpoints to change</li>

          <li>Releasing the control or super key when in one of the
          palettes did not update the tool cursor.</li>

          <li>The point info dlg now comes up beside (rather than
          on top of) the selected point.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>11 Jan 2002

        <ul>
          <li>bdf "fix" of 9 Jan. lost the encoding of the
          font.</li>

          <li>FontForge source included "ushort" in a couple of
          places. Linux must define this but some systems don't. It
          has been changed to uint16 which I define.</li>

          <li>Worked around some imaging bugs of the X server under
          cygwin (FontForge seems to work under cygwin now)</li>

          <li>Using the arrow keys to scroll only worked if
          something were selected. should always work now.</li>

          <li>The fontview now contains an indication of which
          characters have backgrounds</li>

          <li>Minor improvements to merge when given an impossible
          problem.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>9 Jan 2002

        <ul>
          <li>destroy window fix on 2 Jan was not enough, it popped
          up again. Hope I've killed it this time</li>

          <li>FontForge had trouble reading bdf fonts that

            <ul>
              <li>did not have standard X font names
              (-vendor-family-weight-italic-...)</li>

              <li>had the same name used for different
              characters</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>The metrics view got confused by characters with
          negative lbearings.</li>

          <li>Added some Japanese (Kanji) text samples.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>8 Jan 2002

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a bug in gdf output</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>7 Jan 2002

        <ul>
          <li>Added a traditional chinese sample</li>

          <li>In the metrics view, the kerning offset was not
          rescaled when the size of the window changed.</li>

          <li>Added a preference item to control the amount by
          which the arrow keys move selected points</li>

          <li>Changed the behavior of the grid layer so that now
          points will snap to any spline in the grid layer, not
          just horizontal and vertical splines</li>

          <li>Added a preference item to control this snap
          distance.</li>

          <li>Added a couple new outline display sizes to the
          fontview</li>

          <li>Use the "super" modifer to simulate a mouses middle
          button. If the super key (the one with a windows flag on
          it on pc keyboards) is depressed then any mouse click
          will be treated as if it were mouse button 2 that was
          used.</li>

          <li>Minor improvements in truetype hinting</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>4 Jan 2002

        <ul>
          <li>if a dfont (or other mac resource file) contains
          multiple truetype fonts, fontforge will let you pick one
          (before it would read in the first and ignore the
          others)</li>

          <li>The tools palette now shows the mouse bindings.</li>

          <li>Next/Prev control points are drawn in different
          colors now, and those colors are reflected in the point
          get info dlg.</li>

          <li>Merge and Simplify will now retain the slope of curve
          points.</li>

          <li>Simplify will no longer remove points at the extrema
          of their curves (PostScript fonts are supposed to have
          points at the extrema)</li>

          <li>New command in Element menu to <a href=
          "elementmenu.html#Add-Extrema">add points at extrema</a>
          to a spline or set of splines.</li>

          <li>Next/Prev Point commands will shift the screen so the
          newly selected point is visible.</li>

          <li>Metrics View now allows for anti aliased character
          display.</li>

          <li>Metrics View View menu was broken and was missing
          half its entries.</li>

          <li>Revert Font would leave fontforge in a state where
          some commands would cause a crash. Should be fixed
          now.</li>

          <li>TextFields did not scroll properly with the arrow
          keys.</li>

          <li>The outline and bitmap views may be scrolled with the
          arrow keys by holding down either the control or meta
          key.</li>

          <li>When reading a ttf file with an encoding fontforge
          doesn't recognize which has some glyphs which are refered
          to from multiple code points, then fontforge used to
          crash.</li>

          <li>Support Menu key on windows keyboard</li>

          <li>Use the Windows "flag" key as a modifier to indicate
          mouse button 2 (so if that key is depressed, and a mouse
          button is pressed/released pretend it was button2)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>2 Jan 2002

        <ul>
          <li>Copy From has been made global and sticky (each font
          used to have a separate value and it got lost on exit.
          Now there is one global value and it is saved in the
          prefs file).</li>

          <li>Copy From now allows you to control whether a
          character's name should be copied along with the glyph
          data (only in font view).</li>

          <li>View-&gt;Fill should now show the current
          setting.</li>

          <li>If there were background images in a glyph then
          changing the Show/Hide rulers made the display wrong</li>

          <li>In the Outline view, the character's popup box would
          appear if the mouse were over the menubar. Werner thought
          that inappropriate.</li>

          <li>If import bitmaps needed to expand the number of
          characters in a font (to provide slots for all the
          bitmaps) it would fail to do so properly. Resulting in a
          crash.</li>

          <li>Hmm. There appears to be a race condition inside the
          XServer on my machine and if I map a window but destroy
          it before I read the MapNotify (or possibly Expose) event
          on the queue, then the server will calmly crash. This can
          happen if a progress indicator is ended just after we
          decide to display it. I've tried to work around it, but
          there may still be holes.</li>

          <li>Added an "About..." menu entry to display the splash
          screen again</li>

          <li>Gleep! type1 cid font generation had a couple of
          problems</li>

          <li>Print Sample is now available for cid fonts.</li>

          <li>View-AntiAlias didn't work (characters were always
          displayed as antialiased)</li>

          <li>Menus made more responsive to key presses.</li>

          <li>The Zoom In and Out commands are now centered around
          the selection (if there is one, if not they continue to
          use center of the window)</li>

          <li>Changed the order of entries in the Point Info dlg so
          that Prev is above Next</li>

          <li>The Escape key can be used to deselect</li>

          <li>New copyright notices.</li>
        </ul>

      <li>29-Dec-2001

        <ul>
          <li>TextFields had numerous display problems. Should have
          fewer now.</li>

          <li>The 15 Dec image crash fix was not complete, turns
          out there were two memory problems (well, two so
          far)</li>

          <li>Some dialogs could show up half off the right edge of
          the screen. Should not do so now.</li>

          <li>Added a few more language samples for printing.</li>

          <li>Bidi display didn't work when there were lots of
          combining letters around</li>

          <li>Bidi printing didn't work when there was more than
          one line of right to left text</li>

          <li>Typing control characters to the fontview will no
          longer move to that character.

            <ul>
              <li>Typing [Return] opens selected characters</li>

              <li>Typing [Tab] moves to next character with
              something in it.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Depressing the right mouse button invokes a popup
          menu in the fontview now.</li>

          <li>Trying to move a control point with the mouse while
          simultaneously moving the point itself with the arrow
          keys used to cause a crash</li>

          <li>Selecting a bdf font which was in a bad format as a
          background caused a crash.</li>
        </ul>

      <li>19-Dec-2001

        <ul>
          <li>The german ui file should be in better german</li>

          <li>fontforge would not notice that an iso10646 bdf file
          was unicode</li>

          <li>Support for conversion to and from some 2 byte
          encodings (LocalCharset preference item)</li>

          <li>sfd files store the font's encoding as a string
          rather than a number now so if we add more standard
          encodings things won't get screwed up as they were when
          we added johab.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>18-Dec-2001

        <ul>
          <li><span class="c1"><strong>TrueType hints were
          terrible</strong></span>. I fixed one huge bug. There are
          still problems with diagonals and the results are not as
          nice as Fontographer's, but they are better.</li>

          <li>Some more greek fixes.</li>

          <li>Metrics window did not handle the transition from a
          left -&gt; right view to a right-&gt;left one properly
          (mostly this means if you had a blank metrics view and
          you put a hebrew/arabic character into it then that
          character was displayed left to right).</li>

          <li>The transform dialog in the fontview now has a
          checkbox which allows you to control whether you want the
          background transformed in sync with the foreground.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>17-Dec-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed another bug with cid fonts, this one when
          attempting to create such a font in the absence of cidmap
          files</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug when outputting otf cid files (bug
          appeared when I added vertical metrics)</li>

          <li>When loading a cid font FontForge could get caught up
          in an semi-infinite loop asking for cidmap files. Should
          be fixed now.</li>

          <li>Finally got rid of the annoying warning about
          tempnam() when linking.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>16-Dec-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Scrollbars didn't always update in big
          textfields</li>

          <li>Missed the hot key for unlink reference in the font
          view.</li>

          <li>Fixed crash when clearing empty character cells</li>

          <li>More greek accent fixes</li>

          <li>changed character popups slightly.</li>

          <li>Added another problem to find problems. Will now
          check for flipped references (=&gt;counter-clockwise
          paths most of the time)</li>

          <li>Interesting. The EuroFont uses the endchar opcode in
          way that both the type1 and type2 docs claim to be
          illegal (it is not the last thing in the subroutine, it
          is followed by a return). Since EuroFont is from adobe, I
          presume the docs are wrong, so I ignore this error now.
          (The Adobe people insist that the docs are right, just
          misleading. That the endchar is the last thing in the
          subr because nothing after it gets executed. Hmm, I
          continue to be misled)</li>

          <li>FontForge will be better able to figure out where
          hints should be active when it reads in a postscript
          font.</li>

          <li>Autohint will no longer find some erroneous
          hints.</li>

          <li>Autohint will now find the serifs in Nimbus
          Roman</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Copying a background image caused a crash at some
          indeterminate future time</li>

          <li>Made the Help browser configurable</li>

          <li>Changed greek accent processing so that it uses more
          of the greek accents. For reasons known best to
          themselves, unicode tends to map greek varia to grave,
          oxia to acute, etc.</li>

          <li>More work to make sure the screen fonts are
          readable</li>

          <li>tabbing into a text field selects all of it.</li>

          <li>autotrace 2.8 has changed its argument conventions.
          new versions of fontforge will no longer work with
          autotrace2.7.</li>

          <li>If a menu doesn't fit in its window there is now a
          way to get at the menu items which are offscreen</li>

          <li>Cleaned up the panose (fontinfo) window</li>

          <li>Added names to the private use area of unicode for
          greek small caps (starting at 0xf500)</li>

          <li>Fixed a couple of autohint problems</li>

          <li>Manual hint addition might refuse to add a hint if it
          didn't like it. It should now realize that the user is in
          charge...</li>

      <li>14-Dec-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Oops Edward Lee points out that I was missing some
          colons in my eps file generation.</li>

          <li>Hot key added for Unlink Reference</li>

          <li>Werner found two more bugs when reading in cid keyed
          fonts without a corresponding cidmap file.</li>

      </li>

      <li>11-Dec-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a crash if there were no .cidmap files and
          FontForge was not installed in a directory named
          bin.</li>

          <li>Cleaned up the distribution a bit per Werner's
          requests</li>

          <li>Added a ScreenWidthCentimeters resource</li>

          <li>FontForge will no longer ask the X (Font) Server to
          scale bitmap fonts. It will only used unscaled bitmaps or
          outline fonts.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>10-Dec-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a crash when adding (manually) a minimum
          distance hint to the width.</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug in the configure script which caused it
          to fail on solaris</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>9-Dec-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Added proper names for Hangul Syllables</li>

          <li>The Greek fixup wasn't working as it should
          (sometimes would generate two characters named "Delta" in
          pfb files). Should be fixed. Should also be controllable
          by Preference item (ie. you can turn it off if you want
          to)</li>

          <li>The metrics view did not display changes</li>

          <li>The metrics view's cursor sometimes got stuck in the
          wrong shape</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>3-Dec-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Merge Kern Info dlg crashed if you cancelled it.</li>

          <li>The encoding tables in the cmap are supposed to be
          ordered by platform and mine were not.</li>

          <li>FontForge would crash when writing out very large
          copyright notices

            <ul>
              <li>I lifted the 2000 character restriction on
              copyright strings.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>If there were more than 2 lines of tabs in a TabSet
          then clicking on a tab would often cause the wrong pane
          to appear.</li>

          <li>Cleaned up Font Info a bit so it looks better with
          the Russian translations.</li>

          <li>Fixed a memory leak when generating a truetype font
          with an encoding other than unicode.</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash when generating a truetype font which
          referenced characters with encodings bigger than
          65535.</li>

          <li>Added a patch from Ulrich, FontForge now reads class
          based kerning from the GPOS table.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>1-Dec-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Figured out the format of mac .dfont files</li>

          <li>The mac Command (Apple, Cloverleaf) modifier key is
          now treated as if it were the Control key (So users may
          exit FontForge with Command-Q as they expect).</li>

          <li>Another bug reading in flex hints from OTF. Fixed by
          Ulrich Klauer.</li>

          <li>FontForge had problems with drawing images when there
          was an endian mismatch between the X server and the
          machine running fontforge.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>27-Nov-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Build Accented Character failed to update bitmaps in
          CID keyed fonts</li>

          <li>Build Accented Character will generate rotated
          characters when appropriate for CID keyed fonts

            <ul>
              <li>If a character's name is "vertcid_&lt;cid&gt;"
              where &lt;cid&gt; should be replaced by a number,
              then that character will be replaced by a rotated
              version of &lt;cid&gt;</li>

              <li>If a character's name is "vertuni&lt;uni&gt;"
              where &lt;uni&gt; should be replaced by a 4 hex-digit
              number, then that character will be replaced by a
              rotated version of the unicode character
              &lt;uni&gt;.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>When saving a font with rotated characters FontForge
          will now generate a vrt2 feature in the GSUB table (this
          lets the font's users find out about the rotated
          glyphs.</li>

          <li>Before this FontForge would only read entries in the
          'name' table which were in unicode (or macroman).
          FontForge is a bit more general now and will read the
          other encodings it knows about.</li>

          <li>Oops. Another screw up reading in open type.</li>

          <li>If the character at encoding 0 was not .notdef then
          FontForge would omit it when generating a
          postscript/opentype font.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>26-Nov-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Adobe has upgraded their cid version for traditional
          chinese, so I generated a new cidmap to reflect that.
          I've also cleaned up most of the others.</li>

          <li>Initial version of vertical metric support.

            <ul>
              <li>(only in true/open type fonts)</li>

              <li>Added ability to set the vertical advance of each
              character</li>

              <li>Added ability to set the vertical origin (as an
              offset from the origin in the design coordinate
              system (which happens to be the origin for horizontal
              metrics)).</li>

              <li>Added ability to set the line gap (er, column
              gap?)</li>

              <li>What else do I need?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>24-Nov-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Oops. Urich Klauer found a bug in my parsing of
          ttf/otf tables (introduced by the linegap change on 8
          Nov) and sent a patch.</li>

          <li>FontForge was erroneously complaining that all ttf
          composite glyphs were too big (when reading them in,
          introduced 15 Nov).</li>

          <li>FontForge stored StdHW and StdVW in the wrong format
          when reading opentype fonts and any .pfa/b fonts
          generated from that db caused ghostview problems.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>23-Nov-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a potential crash from popups in the
          fontview.</li>

          <li>Fixed three crashes in remove overlap (there are more
          problems)</li>

          <li>Added support for reading/writing mixed 8/16 bit
          encodings. (used in some CJK fonts)</li>

          <li>Added support for big5, johab (johab is untested,
          big5 minimally)</li>

          <li>Improved treatment of ttf encodings we don't
          understand.</li>

          <li>Added a command to move to the next defined character
          (useful in CJK encodings with great holes in the middle.
          Unicode too I suppose)</li>

          <li>Added a resource (<a href=
          "xres.html">fontforge.FontView.FontFamily</a>) to control
          the font for the character labels that appear above every
          user defined character.</li>

          <li>FontForge now supports multi-line copyright notices
          (must be less that 2000 ascii characters though).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>17-Nov-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Changed the configure script to deal with Mac OS/X
          properly (I hope)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>15-Nov-2001

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge had a bug when loading some ttc files which
          caused it to crash.</li>

          <li>FontForge wasn't prepared for the erroneous truetype
          found in wcl-02.ttf, this caused a crash. FontForge
          should do better now.</li>

          <li>FontForge's scrollbars didn't work very well. Should
          be much improved now.</li>

          <li>FontForge used to generate an entire antialiased
          bitmap font to display in the fontview window. Now it
          only generates the images when it needs them. This speeds
          up the loading of large fonts and reduces their memory
          requirements.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>12-Nov-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Some nearly horizontal (but non-linear) splines could
          not be selected.</li>

          <li>Changed the point info dlg so that users could set
          points back to have default control points.</li>

          <li>There was a pathway whereby points could be marked as
          having default control points even when they didn't. That
          one is plugged.</li>

          <li>The chinese font, kaui contains some interesting bugs
          which we've had to work around:

            <ul>
              <li>Glyph 257 contains a contour consisting of one
              off-curve point.</li>

              <li>The encoding cmap refers to non-existent
              glyphs</li>

              <li>The fpgm attempts to move points around (it isn't
              allowed to do that according to the docs)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>11-Nov-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Added support for macintosh resource fonts (by
          reading them from and writing them to macbinary wrapped
          files)</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug in metricsview where pasting with more
          than one character caused a crash.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>8-Nov-2001

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge will now save ligature information in the
          GSUB table when creating an opentype font.</li>

          <li>When double clicking on a previously unused
          character, FontForge would not set the default ligature
          properly.</li>

          <li>FontForge would crash if you merged a font containing
          ligature information into another one (or diagonal stems
          or minimum distances).</li>

          <li>When opening some bdf files, fontforge would display
          nothing until you resized the window.</li>

          <li>Added the ability to set the TTF linegap fields.
          There are two of them (one in OS/2 and one in hhea). I
          don't understand the distinction between them, so I set
          both to the same value.</li>

          <li>When merging fonts, characters which did not fit in
          the current encoding would be placed immediately after
          the last character with something in it. The intent was
          that they should go to an unused slot outside of the
          encoding rather than within. This has been fixed.</li>

          <li>I've added a preference item allowing you to
          configure the separation between the base character and
          the accent in the Build Accented Character command. I've
          also changed it so that if the character is close to the
          x-height or the cap height, the accent is positioned as
          if the character were at the x-height (or cap height),
          this means the accents will be at a consistent level
          rather than slightly ragged.</li>

          <li>I moved the Make First command to the Point
          menu.</li>

          <li>Added a command to copy the splines in the foreground
          layer into the background layer.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>2-Nov-2001

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge would not notice certain disk errors when
          generating truetype fonts. It should do better now.</li>

          <li>FontForge could crash when generating postscript from
          a unicode font that did not contain all the greek
          letters.</li>

          <li>Fixed a display bug in the metrics view.</li>

          <li>FontForge should not be able to read in an opentype
          GPOS table and extract kerning information from it.</li>

          <li>FontForge will now put kerning info into the GPOS
          table when saving an opentype font. TrueType fonts will
          still put kerning info into the kern table.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>31-Oct-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Added a command to remove width MDs &amp; changed ttf
          generation to check if there were any width MDs before
          setting the "metrics depend on pointsize" flag in the
          head table.</li>

          <li>Improved (I hope) placement of palettes under default
          gnome.</li>

          <li>There was a bug in my otf read in of 'hflex1'
          instructions which warped some otf fonts badly.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>29-Oct-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Change type1 encoding vectors so that they start with
          a for loop setting everything to notdef. older versions
          of dvipdfm assume it's there</li>

          <li>Added two new concepts to hinting which only apply to
          truetype:

            <ul>
              <li>You can specify that a certain point should be
              rounded to the grid in x or y<br />
              (note: points on hints don't need this, they'll
              always be rounded)</li>

              <li>You can specify that the x or y distance between
              two points should never vanish (this is called
              Minimum Distance)<br />
              (note: each hint implies one of these going from one
              side of the hint to the other, also there is an
              implied one of these between any two non-overlapping
              hints)<br />
              You can also specify that the distance between a
              point and the width should never vanish. This means
              that there will always be at least one pixel between
              that point and the advance width of the
              character.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>I removed the serif checker from the ttf instruction
          generator and moved it to the autohinter (with some
          changes of course) and it now generates minimum
          distances.</li>

          <li>I added a minimum distance between the last stem of a
          character and the width.</li>

          <li>I added a user interface to display and control
          these</li>

          <li>I realized I was misinterpreting the ttf docs (again)
          and that IUP worked better than I thought, and so I
          removed my own interpolation code (thank you freetype! it
          is so good to see what the instructions do.)</li>

          <li>Cleaned up some rather technical issues in the
          truetype instruction generation occasioned by
          non-overlapping and non-intersecting hints.</li>

          <li>FontForge will now read (but not produce) '.gsf'
          files. These are yet another postscript format, like a
          pfa but without the eexec encoding. Ghostscript uses them
          (others may, I think Wadalab did...).</li>

          <li>Oops. In encodings containing characters with no
          defined postscript unicode names, then the name generated
          for an unused character was wrong.</li>

          <li>Oops. FontForge thought all user defined encodings
          were two byte encodings and produced a warning message
          for them when generating type1 fonts.</li>

          <li>Added a force encoding flag to the Font Info dlg.
          This is for those cases where FontForge reads in a font
          but can't figure out what the proper encoding is, then
          doing a force encoding will simply rename all the
          characters to match what they should be in the chosen
          encoding.</li>

          <li>Oops, neither afm nor bdf files were correctly
          normalized for fonts whose em size wasn't 1000.</li>

          <li>Improved bdf "CHARSET_COLLECTIONS" output.</li>

          <li>Added a command to make two lines parallel</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>21-Oct-2001

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge could crash when autohinting a diagonal
          hint.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>20-Oct-2001

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge generated awful instructions (hints) for
          truetype characters. I've fixed some of the more
          egregious problems (I hope).<br />
            In particular:

            <ul>
              <li>Diagonal hints were completely broken</li>

              <li>Overlapping hints didn't work either</li>

              <li>Normal hints with more than one point on them
              sometimes had the second (third, fourth...) point
              moved by the wrong amount.</li>

              <li>Points that weren't on any hints were often not
              interpolated properly.</li>

              <li>The serif code picked up on things which weren't
              serifs and tried to hint them as though they
              were.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>I've written a <a href=
          "http://mensis.sf.net/">tool</a> which will allow you to
          look at what the instructions are and what they do.</li>

          <li>TTF spline approximation (cubic-&gt;quadratic) should
          be twice as fast.</li>

          <li>Clearing/Cutting a character with references from the
          font view corrupted FontForge's internal state. If this
          were followed by a reduction in the number of characters
          in the font (Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Encoding) a crash
          could occur.</li>

          <li>Clearing/Cutting a character with dependents from the
          font view now gives the user the option of instanciating
          the character in all its dependents.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>11-Oct-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Hmm. Apple has some very strange things to say about
          how offsets and scaling factors overlap in compound ttf
          glyphs. It is not well enough described (at least when it
          applies to rotations) for me to implement it. Microsoft
          doesn't do this. Great. OpenType gives a pair of bits to
          control this behavior (bit 11 set do it apple's way, bit
          12 set do it MS way, neither set flip a coin and guess,
          both set die in horrible agony). But still no description
          of exactly what Apple does. So I've changed my ttf output
          routine always to set bit 12 in the composite flags. And
          the read in does something if it gets the apple bit.
          Probably not the right thing though.</li>

          <li>Fixed a potential problem clipping splines in the
          outline character display.</li>

          <li>Added a warning when attempting to save a font with a
          two byte encoding into a format that only supports one
          byte encodings (ie. unicode to pfb)</li>

          <li>FontForge crashed when loading a bare bdf with more
          than 256 characters</li>

          <li>FontForge used out of date versions of config.guess
          and config.sub. These should be updated now.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>3-Oct-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Added support for saving bitmaps into ttf files. I
          don't know that I've got it right. Windows Me ignores the
          bitmaps I put in. Windows may ignore all bitmaps, or I
          may have done something wrong... There are so few files
          to test bitmaps on though...</li>

          <li>Some older systems have problems taking the cubed
          root of 0. This can pop up in the Cubic Solution code now
          (when doing simplify for example). There should be a
          work-around in place now.</li>

          <li>On monospaced fonts FontForge generated a .notdef
          character whose width was the em-square rather than the
          size of the rest of the font.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>1-Oct-2001

        <ul>
          <li>makefile wouldn't build ui files if "." wasn't in
          PATH environment variable. Should be fixed.</li>

          <li>Holding down the Shift key when invoking
          Element-&gt;AutoTrace will cause it to prompt for command
          line arguments to the autotrace program (you have to
          figure these arguments out yourself).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>30-Sept-2001/1-Oct-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Improved importing background bitmap fonts (scaling
          factor set more accurately, pk characters whose bitmap
          width was a factor of 8 had problems).</li>

          <li>Import width from background bitmap fonts if the
          outline character is empty.</li>

          <li>Merge Fonts was disabled except under bizarre
          circumstances, should be fixed.</li>

          <li>Makefiles should create the *.ui files now.</li>

          <li>Mac encoding table should include the Euro character
          now (I was using an old version which had the currency
          symbol instead).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>24-Sept-2001

        <ul>
          <li><a href="Problems-MacOSX.html">Mac OS/X port</a> done
          (or at least a semi-working version has been
          produced)</li>

          <li>Localization didn't work if there was no preference
          file.
            <hr />
          </li>

          <li>Can now read metafont pk files as bitmap fonts
          (Warning: No encoding on these files, you've got to guess
          at the encoding before loading them).</li>

          <li>Can now read kerning information from TeX .tfm files
          (Again, there's no encoding in these guys, I just assume
          the font's encoding matches the tfm)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>22-Sept-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Can now read bitmap fonts out of a truetype EBDT (or
          bdat) table</li>

          <li>Can import a bitmap and put it into the background of
          a font.</li>

          <li>FontForge would sometimes get character widths wrong
          when reading a ttc file.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>19-Sept-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Major rewrite of Remove Overlap.</li>

          <li>Fixed potential crash in autohint</li>

          <li>I now find the intersection of a (cubic) spline and a
          line by the cubic algorithm rather than by
          iteration.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>15-Sept-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed more remove overlap/merge/simplify problems
          related to having many points at the same location.</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug in Point Info.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>14-Sept-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a couple more memory problems (caused by the
          chunk allocation), one in remove overlap, one in
          autotrace</li>

          <li>I'm told that yesterday's executable upload didn't
          work. Hope today's does better</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>13-Sept-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a crash when joining two paths</li>

          <li>More tweaking of search path for ui files.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>11-Sept-2001

        <ul>
          <li>more configuration fixes</li>

          <li>Fixed many simplify bugs</li>

          <li>otf output would crash if given an open path.
          Fixed</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>8-Sept-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Font View Paste has changed slightly. If the copy
          buffer contains more than one character, and the
          selection is exactly one character, then the selection
          will be changed so that it will exactly fit the copy
          buffer.</li>

          <li>Also Font View Copy will copy the hints of the
          character.</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug with reading CID keyed Type1 fonts</li>

          <li>cleaned up some compilation problems on older systems
          (I hope)</li>

          <li>Inserted Olaf's bug fix in gresource.c</li>

          <li>Cleaned up behavior on zero-length splines</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>5-Sept-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Ug. yesterday's install changes weren't complete. I
          forgot to remove the old files from /usr/local/bin so
          fontforge used out of data translation tables and things
          looked confused for non-English users. Also libgunicode
          had an old version of some header files so there were
          compilation problems if this was tar x'ed last (the other
          packages had the correct headers).</li>

          <li>Also I posted a bad libgdraw source.</li>

          <li>And got the dates wrong.</li>

          <li>Added a tiny bit of German to the ui (hope it's
          right)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>4-Sept-2001 (but posted as 5-Sept-2001)

        <ul>
          <li>Menubar should be redrawn properly after a resize
          now.</li>

          <li>File chooser should be smarter about retaining
          filenames after changing directories.</li>

          <li>Various fixes to support URW's odd habit of
          abbreviating everything to 4 characters (ie. recognize
          "obli" for "oblique", and "medi" for "medium")</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash bug in postscript generation when
          character 0 was deemed worth outputting</li>

          <li>Tweaked XHeight calculation to look for
          greek/cyrillic "x"</li>

          <li>Changed install process to put user-interface files
          into /usr/share/fontforge instead of into the bin
          directory.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>1-Sept-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Small fixes to (my implementation of) Adobe Standard
          Encoding.</li>

          <li>Small tweaks to get things to compile on solaris
          again.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>31-August-2001

        <ul>
          <li>If you dragged on a new spline, and then translated
          one or both of its end-points the spline reverted to its
          default configuration</li>

          <li>TTF files encoded in Wansung/SJIS will be read into a
          font encoded with either KSC5601 or JIS208.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>30-August-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed some bugs in otf output:

            <ul>
              <li>hintmasks were being output incorrectly, omitting
              bytes of data. This could cause horrendous errors. If
              FontForge read in one of these fonts it would often
              report "stack underflow".</li>

              <li>Another hintmask problem caused characters to be
              offset from where they should be.</li>

              <li>Placing a hintmask between multiple [rhv]lineto s
              caused us to skip a line segment</li>

              <li>cleaned up generation of subroutines (used to be
              extraneous rmovetos)</li>

              <li>If the user gave bad input to certain Private
              values (BlueValues for instance), FontForge could go
              into an infinite loop.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Non-CID otf fonts did not get their encodings
          read</li>

          <li>Improved parsing of hints in a type1 font with hint
          substitution</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash bug in Inserting a font (or a blank
          font) into a CID font</li>

          <li>Generate font dialog would sometimes default to
          producing a CID keyed font when it was not
          appropriate.</li>

          <li>I got the ulCodePageRange bits wrong of the CJK
          codepages (which meant that windows thought the wrong
          characters were in the font)</li>

          <li>I generated a bad cmap (ttf encoding) table for CID
          keyed otf fonts.</li>

          <li>If a TTF/OTF font is encoded with KSC5601 or JIS208
          then I will give it a Wansung / SJIS encoding in the cmap
          (if a unicode encoding is desired then reencode as
          unicode).</li>

          <li>Found format for afm files of CID fonts. Can now
          produce such for CID font output.</li>

          <li>Improved reference handling in type1s. If a reference
          doesn't fit into a "seac" then try to use subroutines.
          Subroutines are possible if:

            <ul>
              <li>None of the references in the character use hint
              substitution (or flex hints)<br />
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - or -</li>

              <li>Only one of the references uses hint substitution
              and it isn't translated (not moved)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Improved reference handling in type2s (opentype).
          Allow a reference to a character with hint substitutions
          to go into a subroutine if none of the other referenced
          characters use any hints at all, and the character with
          hint substitutions is not translated.</li>

          <li>Get Info was broken inside outline characters</li>

          <li>Made an attempt to speed up handling of larger fonts.
          Only noticeable difference I've seen is that it speeds up
          freeing the font.</li>

          <li>Added a dialog to show what characters refer to the
          current character</li>

          <li>Made a feeble attempt to sort out the confusion
          engendered by adobe's naming conventions for greek
          letters.

            <ul>
              <li>if a font contains either the of the characters
              U+00B5 or U+03BC then when saving the font FontForge
              ensures that characters with the names: "mu",
              "uni00B5" and "uni03BC" are all present. Similarly
              for Delta, uni0394 uni2206 and Omega, uni03A9
              uni2126</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Added support for command line arguments which begin
          with "--".</li>

          <li>Added -usage and -help arguments</li>

          <li>Added -recover={none,auto,clean} to give you control
          over the autorecovery process.

            <ul>
              <li>-recover=none means that the current run will not
              perform auto recovery but will leave things so that
              the next run will do so. (Note: If you change a font
              that will be recovered later, the results are
              indeterminate).</li>

              <li>-recover=auto default behavior</li>

              <li>-recover=clean cleans out the autorecovery
              directory</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>extension guessing would do the wrong thing if we
          actually wanted to open a font with no extension.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>8-August-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Some minor fixes to gchardlg.c</li>

          <li>Try to upgrade the CJK translation tables to Unicode
          3</li>

          <li>Improve processing of ttc files (I can actually read
          one no)</li>

          <li>chooser icon for cid-keyed fonts</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>6-August-2001

        <ul>
          <li>KSC5601-1987 was still wrong.</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash in FontInfo on CID fonts.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>4-August-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Eek. FontInfo-&gt;Panose,TTF Values never got stored
          into the font.</li>

          <li>Also added access to Version, and UniqueID</li>

          <li>Was given a TTf font with no fontname. This caused a
          crash. FontForge now assigns a fontname if the font
          doesn't provide one.</li>

          <li>Added support (well ability to read) for SJIS, Big5
          and Wansung TTF encodings (platform=3,
          specific=2,3,5)</li>

          <li>After playing with large asian fonts I am now making
          (minimal) attempts to conserve memory and have changed
          all my doubles to floats (it's configurable of course,
          but default is float).</li>

          <li>Fixed a number of bugs in open type output</li>

          <li>Was using out of date Korean-&gt;Unicode conversion.
          Should be fixed now.</li>

          <li>Initial support for <a href="cidmenu.html">CID keyed
          fonts</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>26-July-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Added a constrain points command to align a
          collection of points, or to space points evenly on a
          line.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>25-July-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a rare crash from closing the outline (or
          bitmap) view</li>

          <li>Added a new problem to find problems</li>

          <li>Fixed some small bugs in find problems</li>

          <li>Oops. TrueType names came out in the wrong
          endianness.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>24-July-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Although the family name accepted spaces, it then
          silently removed them. No longer. (I hope)</li>

          <li>FontForge is now more careful when you attempt to
          clear a character from the font view which has dependents
          (at least one of which is not being cleared itself). It
          will warn you and allow you not to clear that
          character.</li>

          <li>FontForge is also more careful when you attempt to
          paste a reference to a character that does not exist in
          the current font. Before it silently ignored it. Now it
          will warn you and give you the option of pasting the
          outlines of the original character being refered to (if
          it can find that character).</li>

          <li>Fixed an uninitialized variable in print that could
          cause things to go into an infinite loop.</li>

          <li>Fixed a rounding error problem in ttf generation that
          could cause an infinite loop.</li>

          <li>Small bitmap fonts will be magnified in the font
          view</li>

          <li>Expand Stroke didn't work on counter-clockwise
          triangles (presumably other shapes, but I didn't check).
          It also would randomly leave paths counter-clockwise when
          they should have been clockwise.</li>

          <li>Finally!<br />
          Often when joining two paths (or closing one path) the
          point would jump when you released the mouse. I finally
          figured out why.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>22-July-2001

        <ul>
          <li>wrote a unicode printf which is now used by most of
          the error routines. Should be no visible difference to
          users.</li>

          <li>cleaned up the truetype names aspect of the font info
          dlg.</li>

          <li>Added a Translate Styles button to the above aspect
          if the string is Style and the language is American
          English. (Sorry about the linguistic chauvinism)</li>

          <li>Allowed spaces in the PostScript family name
          again</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug where the "lpr" radio button would
          sometimes be disabled.</li>

          <li>Various other small improvements to "Print".</li>

          <li>The "Clockwise" detector failed on some paths. I've
          rewritten it, it should work better now.</li>

          <li>The clockwise detector in find problems also needed
          to be rewritten.</li>

          <li>Added a Find Problems detector for almost
          horizontal/vertical control points.</li>

          <li>Some improvements to metafont (well, a few characters
          look better anyway, I hope it's an improvement). It still
          doesn't work of course.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>17-July-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Using almost any stringized error routine would munch
          memory. Many inexplicable errors resulted. I hope it is
          now fixed and that FontForge is stable again.</li>

          <li>Valek's improvements to Find Problems</li>

          <li>Valek's russian version of "A quick brown
          fox..."</li>

          <li>use textarea gadget for Font's copyright notice.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>16-July-2001

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge did not do a very good job of guessing at
          where hints should be active when they were supplied by
          the user. Should do better now.</li>

          <li>More tuneups for autohint.</li>

          <li>Added a command to the outline view to allow you to
          set the "First Point" of each spline set. This is
          important for Interpolate font.</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug in Font Reencoding having to do with
          references.</li>

          <li>Added direction detection to Find Problems (to make
          sure outer paths are clockwise)</li>

          <li>Cleared selections between explanations on Find
          Problems</li>

          <li>Gave some indication of how near horizontal/vertical
          lines are wrong in find problems</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash in MetaFont</li>

          <li>Added a progress indicator to MetaFont</li>

          <li>Added some more to the print sample text (bulgarian,
          macedonian, welsh, czech, lithuanian, polish,
          slovene)</li>

          <li>Stringized some more files</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>15-July-2001

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge should now be able to read truetype
          collection files and do something reasonable --<br />
          At least in theory. I don't have any truetype collection
          files to test on.</li>

          <li>Oh dear. The rasterizer was looking at vertical hints
          when it should have looked at horizontal ones, looking at
          no hints when it should have looked at vertical ones. The
          result was that vertical edges weren't found.</li>

          <li>FontForge had problems reading in lone bdf fonts with
          strange encodings.</li>

          <li>Cleaned up print behavior slightly on systems without
          ghostview</li>

          <li>Find Problems would not always stop immediately after
          pressing the stop button.</li>

          <li>more files stringized</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>11-July-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Eek! Memory problem in metrics view (writing beyond
          what was allocated). Fixed now.</li>

          <li>There is scrollbar in the metricsview again. This
          time it actually does something.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>10-July-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Did significant improvement to arabic ligature
          creation (at least it's done right to left now and the
          proper forms will be picked).</li>

          <li>Improved the character icons of Anti-Aliased
          fonts.</li>

          <li>Oops. FontInfo would mistakenly complain about
          modifiers like "-Bold". Fixed.</li>

          <li>There's the start of a <a href=
          "MetaFont.html">command to change the weight of a
          font</a>. It doesn't work very well yet. It probably
          never will work perfectly, but I hope it may eventually
          be useful.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>7-July-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a crash when referring to a character whose
          encoding was bigger than 65535</li>

          <li>Rewrote the <a href="fontinfo.html">Font Info</a>
          dlg.

            <ul>
              <li>Made the dialog controlled by tabs instead of
              trying to show everything at once.</li>

              <li>Merged the private info dlg into it</li>

              <li>Provided access to some ttf settings which were
              previously hidden</li>

              <li>Provided access to the ttf name table (which
              allows you to give the font and its styles different
              names on different languages. So CaslonItalic could
              be CaslonItalique in French and CaslonKursive in
              German.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>30-June-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed another crash from putting strings in
          resources.</li>

          <li>Added a snap-to feature on horizontal/vertical lines
          in the grid (guide) layer.</li>

          <li>Missing a few files in the distribution of the
          28th.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>28-June-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Oops. Now all empty characters are nameless, not just
          controls.</li>

          <li>Many improvements to <a href="problems.html">find
          problems</a>.</li>

          <li>Added some new shortcuts to the menus.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>27-June-2001

        <ul>
          <li>When generating truetype (or opentype) fonts,
          FontForge failed to set the ulCodePageRange for encodings
          other than latin1/latin2. Should do a better job
          now.</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash introduced by decompress.</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash when trying to merge two paths (by
          moving them with the mouse) when the stationary "path"
          consisted of exactly one point.</li>

          <li>Sometimes control characters would be named "uni0001"
          (etc.) rather than ".notdef". Appropriate, but
          inconsistent. They should now always be called ".notdef"
          (unless explicitly renamed).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>24-June-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Change configure script to work on solaris</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>23-June-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Make giofile.c compile on solaris</li>

          <li>Fix crash in autohint</li>

          <li>Decompress compressed font files automagically before
          loading them</li>

          <li>Update russian version.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>21-June-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Copy Width did not work from the font view</li>

          <li>made the info display in the outline view more
          legible if the locale used "," as decimal point.</li>

          <li>One more attempt to get palettes right. They would
          disappear if you went to a non-outline view window and
          then returned to that same window.</li>

          <li>Some useful information will now be displayed in the
          outline view as you add points to a path.</li>

          <li>And during rectangle, ellipse, polygon and star
          generation.</li>

          <li>Build Composite Char will now create the characters
          0x2000-0x2015 (spaces and rules) if you ask it to.</li>

          <li>Fixed several bugs caused by the resource string
          changed.

            <ul>
              <li>This one showed up in font info when removing
              characters.</li>

              <li>And this on adding an encoding (to font
              info).</li>

              <li>Any simple request for a string got two OK
              buttons (ie. no Cancel)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Added some more strings.</li>

          <li>Cleaned up the hint translation code to work with the
          new (ie. hint substitution, diagonal)</li>

          <li>Improved UI for metrics view as per Valik's
          suggestions

            <ul>
              <li>Before it would wait until you depressed the
              mouse before changing the cursor, now it changes the
              cursor as you move.</li>

              <li>Better cursors (separate cursors for kerning,
              setting rbearing (== width), setting lbearing)</li>

              <li>Selected character is drawn in a different
              color.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Implement ghost/edge hints. (Oops)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>19-June-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Initial version of russian menus</li>

          <li>Recently AutoHint would remove control points from
          splines which traced out a line (ie. if the control
          points were on the line segment between the two end
          points). AutoHint shouldn't muck with things like that.
          And anyway it got it wrong in several cases.</li>

          <li>The simplify command will now remove collinear
          control points from a spline. And if you hold down the
          shift key when invoking the menu the simplify command
          will only do this (and will change its name to
          cleanup).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>18-June-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Oops. FontForge looked in the current directory, not
          the executable's directory for the ui files. Should be
          looking in the executable's dir.</li>

          <li>Oops. The "font has changed" dialog caused a
          crash.</li>

          <li>The simplify command will remove control points if
          the spline traces out a line.</li>

          <li>Cleaned up diagonal hints</li>

          <li>Made a change to menus which might fix Valek's menu
          crash. Or might not.</li>

          <li>Added some more strings to the ui files (yesterday
          files can't be used any more)</li>

          <li>Cleaned up some problems with the metrics view.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>17-June-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Added a minimal help menu</li>

          <li>If the Hint menu was invoked when there were not
          exactly two points selected, then fontforge would crash.
          Fixed</li>

          <li>Created a superstructure to allow localization of the
          UI. Created a small (incomplete, probably wrong in many
          places) french ui.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>13-June-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Palettes would vanish when the first outline
          character view was closed. That should be fixed.</li>

          <li>Palettes should (I hope) do a better job of tracking
          windows.</li>

          <li>Fixed another clipping problem</li>

          <li>Added support for diagonal stems (for truetype
          instructioning. Not supported by postscript hints)

            <ul>
              <li>AutoHint finds them</li>

              <li>There's a Clear DStem command, and an Add
              DStem</li>

              <li>Review Hints does not display them (they can't be
              described the same way as H and V stems).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Changed the background color to be dark green so it
          will stand out against a filled character</li>

          <li>Previously if FontForge were given a corrupted font
          with no font name it would crash. That should be
          fixed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>11-June-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Added ability to create a pfm file (for ATM under
          windows)</li>

          <li>Extended Font Info to allow you to set the FullName
          (the human readable font name) from FontInfo</li>

          <li>Two bugs with hint substitution code:

            <ol>
              <li>It would occasionally generate one subr
              containing overlapping hints</li>

              <li>It would create a Subrs array much bigger than
              needed. For some reason xfs had conniptions over the
              blank (but unused) entries</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>6-June-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Cleaned up Exit, close and fontinfo commands to avoid
          possible race conditions.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>5-June-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Added a command to look for common problems</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash caused by removing character slots from
          a font (using Number of Characters in Font Info)</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash caused by reading in a ttf file where
          the kerning info specified a non-existent glyph</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash caused by reading in a pf* file where
          the encoding was specified in a slightly different format
          from the one we expect</li>

          <li>Palettes should be controllable again.</li>

          <li>Menu shortcuts should be available from palettes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>12-May-2001

        <ul>
          <li>That was a stupid idea (yesterday's). I've backed it
          out. Instead I've done what Val asked for -- all windows
          share common palettes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>11-May-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Made a preference item so that palettes could live
          within the outline view. It's sort of a temporary hack
          until I get palettes working (if ever) so it isn't really
          well integrated with things...</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>10-May-2001

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a crash bug which occurred when doing
          Transformations with the origin set to Center of
          Selection (default) in a character with an unclosed
          path.</li>

          <li>Fixed a similar crash when generating
          postscript.</li>

          <li>And another when updating control points.</li>

          <li>Added much to printing, should be done for now.</li>

          <li>Valrk Filippov suggested that things should be
          constrainable to angles other than horizontal, vertical
          and 45. In particular constraining to the ItalicAngle of
          an Italic/Oblique font is very useful. So we do that now.
          Thanks Val!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>7 May 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed more locale problems (I hope)</li>

          <li>Info line should show the location of a point moved
          with the arrows.</li>

          <li>Added Next/Prev Point commands</li>

          <li>Added a Print to file command that displays the
          entire font, or fills a page with the current character.
          More options to follow.</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug in seac output</li>

          <li>Fixed an introduced crash bug in hint output</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash bug caused by increasing the number of
          characters allowed in the font with FontInfo.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>6 May 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Redid <a href="hinting.html">hinting</a> to support
          hint substitution and counter hinting in PostScript
          (&amp; opentype)

            <ul>
              <li>Hints now have an extent in both dimensions,
              indicating over what parts of a character they should
              be active.</li>

              <li>Dotted lines are used to show the extent of a
              hint in the primary dimension</li>

              <li>I draw horizontal hints and vertical hints in
              different colors now, otherwise it was too confusing
              guessing which was which.</li>

              <li>If a hint conflicts with another its dotted lines
              are shown in cyan (rather than light blue/green)</li>

              <li>When the Review hints dlg is active the current
              hint is shown in dark blue/green.</li>

              <li>The Review hints dlg shows whether a hint
              overlaps (conflicts with) another.</li>

              <li>Auto Hinting will generate a list of all
              horizontal and vertical stems, and then use some
              heuristics to remove some of the more annoying and
              less useful stems from the Hint list. If you don't
              want this automatic pruning then holding the Shift
              key down when you invoke AutoHint from the menu will
              leave you with the full stem list.</li>

              <li>Minor changes to truetype output to deal with the
              new hint list.</li>

              <li>Major changes to PostScript output to deal with
              counters and hint substitution</li>

              <li><span class="c1"><strong>No longer saves Type1
              charstrings when loading a type1
              font</strong></span></li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>The icon for outline character windows was
          <em>still</em> wrong for anti-alias fonts if there were
          no bitmap fonts installed. Sigh.</li>

          <li>Added a Correct Direction command to the font
          view.</li>

          <li>Fixed many bugs with Correct Direction</li>

          <li>Improved accent placement when we have serifs (I
          hope), don't want to center on top serif of "i" for
          example.</li>

          <li>Slight improvements when pasting bitmaps.</li>

          <li>Oops. 0x2d should be "hyphen" in the Adobe Standard
          Encoding rather than "minus" as I had it.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>3 May 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Opps. Generating postscript could crash if there were
          many blank characters.</li>

          <li><span class="c1"><strong>This is the last version
          which will allow you to make small modifications to fonts
          while retaining the original hint
          substitution</strong></span></li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>28 Apr 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Transform from the font view will (for some
          transformations and if <a href="editmenu.html#From">Copy
          From</a> is set to All Fonts) transform the bitmap
          associated bitmap characters as well as the outline
          characters.</li>

          <li>Cleaned up Build Accented character so that it
          behaves consistently between font/outline views, works
          with Copy From. The two different aspects of the command
          (Accented vs. Composite) are now controlled by whether
          the Shift key is down when the menu is invoked.</li>

          <li>Some more locale tweaking for reading in/writing out
          postscript.</li>

          <li>The Preference encoding for new fonts didn't work if
          set to a user defined encoding. Should be fixed now.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>27 Apr 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Tangent points should display a little better
          now.</li>

          <li>If a font is a 94x94 CJK font then the LanguageGroup
          field of the Private dictionary will be set to 1.</li>

          <li>Fixed a recently introduced crash bug that happens on
          non-unicode fonts with accented characters.</li>

          <li>If a character contained a reference and that
          character could not be converted into a seac then there
          would be no hints for the reference. That should be fixed
          now.</li>

          <li>Accented bitmaps should be positioned better
          now.</li>

          <li>Added a couple of progress indicators to font level
          operations (transform, paste, etc.)</li>

          <li>Expand stroke didn't work from the font view.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>23 Apr 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a clipping problem</li>

          <li>Redid a change from yesterday. It should now work for
          the stuff that used to work (as well as for what I fixed
          yesterday)</li>

          <li>(moved to <a href="http://sourceforge.net"><img src=
          "http://sourceforge.net/sflogo.php?group_id=25752&amp;type=1"
          width="88" height="31" border="0" alt=
          "SourceForge Logo" /></a>)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>22 Apr 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Added code to allow users to select more than one
          bitmap font at a time to be imported into an sfd.</li>

          <li>Cleaned up opening a bdf file.</li>

          <li>Fixed various crash bugs dealing with missing bitmap
          characters where there were outline characters.</li>

          <li>Fixed various problems with building greek accented
          characters (Unicode 3's decompositions are no longer
          helpful)</li>

          <li>Added some support for <a href=
          "http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/type/corporateuse.txt">
          Adobe's documented corporate use</a> characters (Small
          Caps, Old Style numbers...)</li>

          <li>Cleaned up the outline character's icon (got broken
          when I added anti-aliasing)</li>

          <li>em space character kept vanishing. Fixed that.</li>

          <li>Fixed many other small bugs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>20 Apr 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Addition improvements to the handling of format0
          (1byte) encodings</li>

          <li>Put a Symbol encoding into the FontInfo encoding
          list.</li>

          <li>Oops. Ligature's had their semi-colons in the wrong
          place in afm files.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>19 Apr 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Yesterday's builds were transferred as ASCII not
          BINARY and are totally useless.</li>

          <li>Added a macintosh encoding to ttf output</li>

          <li>Slight improvement to ttf output (I hope)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>18 Apr 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Crash when reading a ttf font fixed (introduced by
          ligature code).</li>

          <li>Crash when generating almost any postscript Type1
          font (recently introduced)</li>

          <li>Added code to read ligature information from the
          TTF/OTF GSUB table.</li>

          <li>List buttons near the bottom of the screen would
          popup their list in inappropriate places.</li>

          <li>Fixed two bugs in cubic-&gt;quadratic spline
          conversion.</li>

          <li>Added support for TrueType Symbol encodings</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>17 Apr 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Menus would go into an infinite loop if you:
          depressed the mouse on the menu bar (and pulled down a
          menu) and then moved the mouse so that it was above the
          menubar when the menu was below it. Should be fixed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>12 Apr 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Added a submenu of recent files and a pull down list
          in the open dlg.</li>

          <li>Added stuff to put ligature info into an afm file
          (But not the GSUB table of ttf/otf)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>10 Apr 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a crash bug when making an encoding from a font
          with a non-unicode character in it.</li>

          <li>Reencoding a font got confused if the new encoding
          contained more than one instance of the same glyph
          (common example is to have both 0x20 and 0xA0 point to
          space) or if it contained a non-unicode character. This
          should be fixed now.</li>

          <li>Fixed a couple of problems with reading otf
          files</li>

          <li>Added ability to save an Open Type font</li>

          <li>Added a "Round to Int" command</li>

          <li>.sfd files contain decimal points. This means they
          are locale specific. Changed the input routines so that
          it would accept either "." or "," as a decimal
          point.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>2 Apr 2001

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge provides some support for XUIDs</li>

          <li>FontForge now has a button in the font info dialog
          which may be able to guess the italic angle for the
          font.</li>

          <li>AutoWidth/Kern didn't work well when the font was
          missing "A"</li>

          <li>AutoWidth/Kern didn't work well when the font was
          italic/oblique</li>

          <li>Build Accented Character didn't work too well when
          the font was italic/oblique</li>

          <li>Previously opening a Type1 font failed to read
          /OtherSubrs correctly</li>

          <li>Oops. In the Open Font Dialog, typing a wildcard
          changed the default button to [New] rather than [Filter].
          And pressing on [Filter] caused a crash.</li>

          <li>Added ability to open an Open Type font (PostScript
          Type2 in a TrueType wrapper)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>29 Mar 2001

        <ul>
          <li>It is now possible to edit bdf fonts directly
          (without first creating a dummy postscript font to
          contain them)</li>

          <li>Fixed crash bug under kde</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>28 Mar 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Made it possible to for the user to new
          encodings</li>

          <li>(added TeX base encoding)</li>

          <li>slight improvements to the palette code</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>26 Mar 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a clipping problem in the Metricsview</li>

          <li>Fixed various other display problems in Metrics</li>

          <li>Fixed various display problems in the fontview</li>

          <li>Added "Remove All Kern Pairs" menu item</li>

          <li>Fixed Auto Kern yet again</li>

          <li>Added a preference item to control the foundry name
          for generated bdf fonts.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>25 Mar 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Oops. Fixed a typo in auto-kerning code. It should
          work now...</li>

          <li>From the outline view, exporting to a bmp file allows
          you to save an anti-aliased character as well as a
          bitmap.</li>

          <li>The Generate Fonts command allows you to save
          anti-aliased greymap fonts. The format they are saved in
          was invented by me an hour ago so it's totally useless
          (it's exactly the same as bdf except there's one extra
          header "BITSPERPIXEL" which may be 1, 2, 4 or 8 (1 would
          be the same as bdf), and the number of pixels packed into
          a byte is 8/BITSPERPIXEL (so 8, 4, 2 or 1
          respectively).</li>

          <li>If you selected "No Outline font" in the Generate
          fonts dialog, it would generate a postscript font anyway.
          This has been fixed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>24 Mar 2001

        <ul>
          <li>AutoKerning now lets you specify the number of
          kerning pairs the font may have.</li>

          <li>I'm told that ttf fonts can only have 2048 kerning
          pairs, so if a font has more, the ttf generator will only
          save the 2048 ones with the biggest (absolute) kerning
          offset.</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug in autowidth (would make some characters
          far too wide).</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug in autokern which caused it to kern
          things too closely together. This also reduced the number
          of kern pairs generated.</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash when loading a truetype font (if a
          glyph's start point and end point were both off-curve
          points then the point between them was interpolated
          incorrectly).</li>

          <li>FontForge should now work with XFree 4.0.* before it
          would crash after putting up the splash screen.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>21 Mar 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed yet another remove overlap bug.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>12 Mar 2001

        <ul>
          <li>a number of small improvements</li>

          <li>fixed a crash bug (occurred when holding down the alt
          key, using the pointer tool, and no reference was
          selected)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>9 Mar 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a small bug in the hinting of glyph 0 (the
          unknown character)</li>

          <li>Added "rulers" to the character outline view</li>

          <li>Expanded the abilities of the postscript
          importer</li>

          <li>Fixed yet another clipping bug.</li>

          <li>Fixed a problem displaying tangent points when the
          control point was less than 1 unit away</li>

          <li>Provides an interface to the autotrace program to
          autotrace background images</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash when drawing large images.</li>

          <li>Fixed a problem with detecting clockwise paths.</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug with reading in Type3 fonts</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>5 Mar 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Minimal truetype instructing (hinting) is now in
          place.

          <li>This includes applying instructions to all points
          that lie on the Hints generated for PostScript, a certain
          amount of extra effort to detect serifs, and application
          of the PostScript BlueValues to the TrueType cvt.</li>

          <li>AutoHint has been improved for some characters
          again.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>4 Mar 2001

        <ul>
          <li>When Get Info is applied to a single selected
          reference character the dialog now has a button which
          will bring up a window displaying the character refered
          to.</li>

          <li>The Font View now displays info on the current
          character</li>

          <li>Selecting by dragging out a rectangle in the
          character outline view would sometimes miss points. I
          think that's fixed.</li>

          <li>Doing a multi-character copy in the fontview would
          remove non-existent characters from the copy set. They
          are no longer removed.</li>

          <li>Build Accented character would always use a dotlessi
          when building an character based on an "i". This behavior
          is only correct if the accent added is above the letter.
          Adding an ogonek for example should retain the dot. This
          is now fixed. (In theory the same problem could occur for
          j, but I don't think there are any cases where it
          does).</li>

          <li>When generating a type1 font FontForge will detect
          whether Flex hints can be used and use them if
          appropriate.</li>

          <li>There was a bug in the routine that read in flex
          hints. It would leave behind 6 extra points not on any
          path in most characters with a flex hint. These points
          were not harmful, but they should not have been
          there.</li>

          <li>I found some cases where autohint picked the wrong
          hints. I cleaned them up. I hope I haven't broken
          others...</li>

          <li>Fixed another clipping problem.</li>

          <li>(Various experiments with instructing truetype have
          yielded no display improvement)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>25 Feb 2001

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge no longer crashes on high-end systems where
          the default visual has a smaller depth than the maximum
          the screen supports.</li>

          <li>FontForge no longer crashes on systems with no bitmap
          unicode fonts installed.</li>

          <li>When FontForge reads in a Type1 font it will preserve
          the original character strings (the type1 strings that
          define the glyph shape) and will write them out again
          when you save the font. If you modify a character (even
          something innocuous like setting the width) the string
          for that character will be lost. This means that any
          characters you do not modify will retain flex hints and
          hint substitution. (the Subrs and OtherSubrs arrays are
          also preserved).</li>

          <li>There is now a way to edit the entries in the Private
          dictionary (well most of them. No way to edit the Subrs
          entry). The program will guess at good values for some
          entries (like StdHW or BlueValues). If there is no
          BlueValues entry present when a type1 font is generated
          then the program will guess at good values (and will also
          guess at values for OtherBlues), otherwise it will use
          the one supplied. Similarly for StdHW and StdVW (if StdHW
          is absent then the program will guess at SnapStemH too,
          similarly for SnapStemV). If UniqueID is present in the
          Private dictionary then that value will be used in the
          font dictionary, if no UniqueID is present then the
          program will generate a random number in the allowed
          range.
            <hr />
          </li>

          <li>Removed a number of warnings from the code</li>

          <li>Made arrow keys functional in the fontview</li>

          <li>Changed type0 unicode generation so that if the font
          does not contain U+2700-U+27FF the printer's own
          ZapfDingbats (if present) will be mapped there.</li>

          <li>Added Adobe Standard to the Font Info Encoding
          list.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>20 Feb 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed some problems in saving both Type1s and
          TrueType fonts.</li>

          <li>Added clipping code to the outline character view.
          (Before at magnifications around 100 or so we'd run into
          overflow problems)</li>

          <li>Added progress widget to font generation (and font
          database saving)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>13 Feb 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed some problems with the configure script
          (handles libraries now)</li>

          <li>Added a progress widget to show how things are going
          on long operations (currently only font opens)</li>

          <li>Fixed numerous small annoyances</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash I introduced into build accented
          characters.</li>

          <li>Fixed a couple of bugs in truetype generation</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>11 Feb 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Added a configure script</li>

          <li>Rearranged (simplified) the directory structure</li>

          <li>Improved the build accented character function</li>

          <li>(similar improvements to display of unicode text (in
          text fields, etc.) with composing characters)</li>

          <li>BiDi text was previously confused by composed
          characters and would put them on the wrong letter.
          Fixed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>9 Feb 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Tweaked some include files so fontforge might compile
          under Irix</li>

          <li>Added anti-aliasing code to the font view.</li>

          <li>Fixed bugs where server has 24bit depth but 32bit
          pixel size</li>

          <li>Added a resource which turn palettes off (so they
          stop trying to steal focus and stop trying to track the
          main window)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>7 Feb 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Some improvement in processing of postscript names in
          true type fonts (will make truetype output marginally
          smaller in most cases)</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug with popup menus.</li>

          <li>Holding down the meta key allows you to drag (rather
          than resize) references which fill the bounding box.</li>

          <li>Improved saving of both postscript and truetype fonts
          when there are composite characters referring to other
          composites.</li>

          <li>Fixed bug in file chooser where typing into the
          listbox (to select a file) made it think (sometimes) that
          it had a directory.</li>

          <li>Fixed bug in Goto Char code where it would refuse to
          go to a character's location (sometimes) if the character
          had not been created yet.</li>

          <li>Improved drawing of palettes on indexed displays</li>

          <li>Improved accent processing in build accented
          characters</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>26 Jan 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed a bug that kept the file chooser (the open file
          dlg, etc.) from browsing the root directory.</li>

          <li>Realized that libgif is just a symbolic link to
          libungif. Made the readgif routine use either one</li>

          <li>A typo in writepng caused it to require libpng at
          link time, this has been fixed, it should now only need
          libpng if someone actually loads a png file.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>21 Jan 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Added a preference dlg. Not much in it as yet.</li>

          <li>fixed a number of bugs

            <ul>
              <li>Timers sometimes failed to go off -&gt; splash
              screen might not vanish, popups might not pop,
              autosave might not happen...</li>

              <li>Vertical lines might cause divide by 0 errors on
              some systems when reading in a font</li>

              <li>Some fonts were thought not to have characters
              they actually had.</li>

              <li>94x94 fonts were encoded as 92x94 (losing 188
              characters)</li>

              <li>Fixed problems with kuten decoding</li>

              <li>Fixed various crashes involving selecting and
              deselecting non-existent characters</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>9 Jan 2001

        <ul>
          <li>Added Tom Harvey's man page to the distribution
          (Thanks Tom!)</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug where radio buttons, etc. sometimes got
          left highlit</li>

          <li>Added an interpreter for (some) postscript type 3
          fonts</li>

          <li>made libgdraw and friends into one shared
          library</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

          Width)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>4 Jan 2001

        <ul>

          <li>Fixed some problems with build accented
          character</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

          <li>More remove overlap corrections</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>21 Dec 2000

        <ul>
          <li>I think I'm reading xfig splines properly now. The
          conversion to postscript still leaves something to be
          desired, but it's as good as I'm likely to make it.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>20 Dec 2000

        <ul>
          <li>Generate Fonts can produce TrueType</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>17 Dec 2000

        <ul>
          <li>TrueType reader now gets (horizontal) kerning
          info</li>

          <li>Added code that automagically preserves changes if
          the program should crash (but does not save on the source
          file unless you ask it to).</li>

          <li>Added a Revert File command.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>16 Dec 2000

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge will now read in a TrueType font

            <ul>
              <li>(it doesn't read hints from the font)</li>

              <li>(it doesn't read bitmaps from the font)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>14 Dec 2000

        <ul>
          <li>Got FontForge to build on a netbsd alpha box</li>

          <li>Added Auto Width &amp; Auto Kern commands</li>

          <li>If you do a translation which is of the entire
          outline character and is only in the x-direction, then
          all the character's hints will be translated too, and if
          the character is a letter then in any characters which
          depend on this one, the other things in the character
          will also be translated.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>12 Dec 2000

        <ul>
          <li>Added a skew command to the bitmap view</li>

          <li>Added Interpolate Fonts</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>11 Dec 2000

        <ul>
          <li>fixed more remove overlap bugs (don't know of any
          left)</li>

          <li>Added Merge Font command</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>10 Dec 2000

        <ul>
          <li>fixed many small bugs with constrained movements</li>

          <li>fixed many autohinting bugs</li>

          <li>Fixed some remove overlap bugs</li>

          <li>Added backup files when saving sfd files</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>5 Dec 2000

        <ul>
          <li>Added a command that automagically builds an accented
          (or general composite) character. (<a href=
          "elementmenu.html#Accented">see below</a>)</li>

          <li>Added support for various CJK encodings (JIS 208, JIS
          212, old KSC 5601, GB 2302, all 94x94)</li>

          <li>Implemented a fairly poor importer/exporter of xfig
          files. (I don't know how to convert XSplines to Bézier
          Splines reasonably).</li>

          <li>Implemented a metrics window, added support for
          kerning (kern info only lives in the afm file, not in the
          font itself)</li>

          <li>Metrics window will also display text from bitmap
          fonts (but you mayn't change a bitmap's metrics)</li>

          <li>Reexamined palette code with transient windows. It
          seems to work on kde now.</li>

          <li>Fixed blinking cursor on 8&amp;16 bit-depth
          displays</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>1 Dec 2000

        <ul>
          <li>Generate &amp; save bitmaps</li>

          <li>Bitmap editor (added a couple of tools like flipping
          and corner turning, circle drawing, etc. that aren't in
          fontographer)</li>

          <li>fontview can display a bitmap, if it does then double
          clicking on a char will display the bitmap</li>

          <li>Changing the width of a character (in outline view)
          will automatically change the width of all bitmaps of
          that character. Also if the character is a letter and
          there are accented characters which refer to it and the
          accented characters have the same with that the letter
          used to have, then the accented characters (and their
          bitmaps) will also have their width updated.</li>

          <li>Can import and export bitmap images into bitmap
          window</li>

          <li>Can import a bdf file</li>

          <li>Can copy and paste in the fontview (bitmaps can be
          affected as well as outlines)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>28 Nov 2000

        <ul>
          <li>Improved star tool</li>

          <li>Made font view functional, can apply to many outline
          characters at once

          <li>Added Correct Path Direction</li>

          <li>Added Remove Overlap (probably very buggy)</li>

          <li>Enhanced support for Unicode, added type0 font
          output.</li>

          <li>Added type3 output (not compressed type 3, can't open
          a type3 or type0)</li>

          <li>Sped up background image drawing.</li>

          <li>Implemented drag-resize of images and referenced
          characters</li>

          <li>Added Rectangle, Ellipse, Polygon and Star
          tools.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>14 Nov 2000

        <ul>
          <li>Added expand stroke</li>

          <li>Paths stored in .sfd files are now closed (bug
          fix)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>13 Nov 2000

        <ul>
          <li>Added the equivalent of a .fog file (Spline Font
          Database, sfd files)</li>

          <li>Implemented transform tools</li>

          <li>continued fixing palettes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>11 Nov 2000

          characters</li>

          <li>Transform allows you to pick origin</li>

          <li>Bunch of menu items for manual hinting added. (I hope
          I'm done with hints now... at least till I look at
          truetype)</li>

          <li>Clockwise now agrees with Fontographer (and everyone
          else)</li>

          <li>Added "pen" , and a knife tools</li>

          <li>(Added many other tools pictures, but they aren't
          implemented yet)</li>

          <li>Fixed many palette problems. (including kde's not
          doing menu shortcuts)</li>

          <li>Put in menu items to show/hide palettes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>9 Nov 2000

        <ul>
          <li>It can now calculate hints, font wide stem hints and
          character specific hints.</li>

          <li>Transform should do rotations right now.</li>

          <li>Metamorphosis file format bug should be fixed</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

    <p>FontForge (as PfaEdit) was initially made available (on the

    started coding it in approximately Sept of 2000.</p>
