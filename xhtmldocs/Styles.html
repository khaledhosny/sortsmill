    <p>The Style sub-menu provides a series of dialogs which allow
    you to create some common stylistic variations of latin
    fonts.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Stems and their widths<br />
      Modification of a Stem's width makes the font appear Bolder
      or Lighter</li>

      <li>Counters and their widths (a counter is the white space
      between stems)<br />
      Modification of a Counter's width makes the font appear
      Expanded or Condensed</li>

      <li>Left and Right Side Bearings<br />
      Behavior similar to Counter's</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The results will probably always need to be examined and
    fixed up by the human eye, but they may provide a help in
    changing a font's attributes.</p>

    <p>It "works" best on sans serif, non-Oblique fonts.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>Bold</h3>

    <p>Bold fonts have thicker stems and are slightly more extended
    than normal fonts. In Knuth's Computers &amp; Typesetting, the
    bold fonts have a stem width that is approximately 1.6 (1.68(at
    12pt)-1.5(at 5pt)) times the stem width of the normal font.
    This is very similar to the 1.75 suggested by Microsoft's ratio
    of 700/400 (700 being the numeric weight of a bold font, and
    400 being the numeric weight of a normal font).</p>

    <p>In Knuth's Computer Modern Bold Extended Roman, the "m"
    glyph is extended to 1.15 times the width of the "m" in
    Computer Modern Roman, and the x-height is 1.03 times
    higher.</p>

    <h3>Point Size</h3>

    <p>At first glance this does not seem like much of a
    transformation, after all postscript and truetype fonts can be
    drawn at any pointsize. But traditionally, as the point-size
    decreases the boldness (thickness of the stems) increases
    slightly, the counters and side bearings also change, and the
    overshoot increases. For metal type there were generally three
    drawings for a glyph in a given font, one for pointsizes less
    than 10, one for pointsizes 10,11 and 12, and one for display
    sizes (above 12). Most computer vector fonts do not show this
    change, while Knuth's Computer Modern fonts have a
    continuum:</p>

    <p>To the left is an example of the same word (taken from a

    <h3>SmallCaps</h3>

    <p>A SmallCaps font is made by <a href=
    "transform.html">scaling</a> the capital letters approximately
    to the x-height (so that they are the same height as lower case
    letters without ascenders) and then adjusting the stem widths
    (emboldening) so that they too will match stem widths of the
    lower case.</p>

    <h3>Italic</h3>

    <p>The Italic transformation contains at least five parts: A
    change in the letterforms of the lowercase letters, a slight
    decrease in x-height, a <a href="transform.html">skew</a>, and
    a condensation and a narrowing of the vertical stems..</p>

    <h3>Extended/Condensed</h3>

    <p>In these two transformations the stem width is held constant
    but the horizontal counter sizes and side bearings are
    increased (or decreased for condensed).</p>

    <h3>The <a name="Embolden">Change</a> Weight dialog<img src=
    "ChangeWeight.png" width="332" height="281" align=
    "right" /></h3>

    <p>The Change Weight dialog starts out by stroking the glyph
    (Element-&gt;Expand Stroke) and removing the internal contour.
    This means that each stem in the glyph will now be wider by the
    number of em units specified at the top of the dialog. Of
    course, this number may be negative, in which case you will be
    making a lighter, rather than a bolder variant of the
    glyph.</p>

    <p>You may find that in some cases the <a href=
    "Styles.html#changeglyph">Change Glyph</a> dialog will do a
    better job of emboldening or thinning a font. Instead of
    increasing all stems by the same fixed amount it will increase
    the thickness of each stem proportionate to its current
    thickness.</p>

    <p><img src="BoldHiraDA.png" width="270" height="270" align=
    "left" />For CJK fonts, with complex shapes but without the
    constraint of the latin baseline and cap height, this expansion
    is probably enough. The image at right shows the Hiragana DA
    syllable -- the original glyph shape is in the background, and
    the expanded shape is in the foreground.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <p>However if we do that to a latin (or Greek, or Cyrillic)
    glyph the result is rather odd because the glyph no longer
    rests on the baseline, and also extends above the cap-height
    (or x-height, or whatever line bounds this particular
    glyph).</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="2">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p class="c2"><img src="BexpandCJK.png" width="125"

        </td>

        <td><img src="BexpandBigSerifs.png" width="213" height=
        "236" /></td>
      </tr>

      <tr valign="top">
        <td>Here the glyph has been expanded as if it were a CJK
        glyph. Note that it now extends below the baseline and
        above the cap height. That is not good.</td>

        <td>
          Here the glyph has been expanded as before, but the
          bottom stem has been moved up just enough so that it now
          rides on the base line, and the top stem has been moved
          down so it sits on the cap height.

          <p>But the counters are now much narrower than they were
          in the original glyph, and the left and right side
          bearings have become squeezed.</p>
        </td>

        <td>In the final example, the glyph is expanded, the top
        and bottom stems moved appropriately, the side bearings
        restored to their original size, and the internal counters
        expanded to be closer to their original size.</td>

        <td>Now consider the case of a serifed font. The serifs on
        the B above have become huge, disproportionally bigger than
        they were in the original glyph.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p><img src="ChangeWeight.png" width="332" height="281" align=
    "left" />Going back to the original dialog. The first field
    specifies the amount by which each stem should get bigger.</p>

    <p>The radio buttons let you choose which method to use. CJK
    simply expands the glyph and leaves it at that. LCG expands the
    glyph and then forces it between the baseline and
    caps/x-height. Auto will chose which of those methods to apply.
    Custom will basically use the LCG method but allows you to
    specify, manually, what the interesting regions are in this
    particular glyph.</p>

    <p>Any point above or on "Top Hint" will be moved down. Or if a
    point is on a hint which surrounds "Top Hint" it will also be
    moved down. (Points on the top stem of "B")</p>

    <p>Any point below or on "Bottom Hint" will be moved up. Or if
    a point is on a hint which surrounds "Bottom Hint" it will also
    be moved up. (Points on the bottom stem of "B")</p>

    <p>Any point which is on a hint which falls somewhere between
    Top Zone and Bottom Zone will be fixed where it is. (Points on
    the middle stem of "B").</p>

    <p>Any point which is Serif Height above the "Bottom Hint" (or
    Serif Height below Top Hint) will remain where it is, meaning
    that some simple serifs will not be expanded to an
    inappropriate size.</p>

    <p>Any other points will be interpolated between the points
    which move (rather like the TrueType IUP instruction -- indeed,
    the process of making a glyph bolder is very like instructing a
    glyph).</p>

    <p>[] Cleanup Self Intersect has the same meaning as the same
    field in the Expand Stroke dialog.</p>

    <p>And for the counters, &lt;&gt; Squish will result in the
    small counters that come from expanding the glyph without doing
    anything to the counters, &lt;&gt;Retain will attempt to retain
    the counters, and &lt;&gt;Auto will Squish CJK glyphs and
    Retain LCG glyphs.</p>

    <h2><a name="Italic">Italic</a> dialog</h2>

    <p>Let me reiterate that the italic transformation is quite
    different and much more complex than the oblique
    transformation. Oblique fonts are made by the same simple
    mathematical operation applied to the entire font. The italic
    transformation can be different for each glyph.</p>

    <p>Let me further add that FontForge will never be able to do
    everything that should be done to make a good italic font from
    an upright font. It may provide a helpful starting point. Some
    of my friends who know more about typography than I have urged
    me not to write this dialog, saying that each italic font
    should be made by hand, and there is much truth to their view.
    I made the dialog anyway because I found it interesting to do
    so. Be warned: It isn't complete. You need to examine what it
    has done and be prepared to redo many characters (especially
    lower case letters) which it has not been able to adapt.</p>

    <p>The complexities of italic design stem from its origin. The
    Latin alphabet as we now know it evolved over time. The upper
    case letters come from the style the Romans used when carving
    inscriptions on their monuments. The lower case letters come
    from a monastic script style, uncials, which were later paired
    with the monumental capitals. The italic hand was another
    script, initially monocase. Just as the lower case letters come
    from a different stylistic tradition than the upper case (and
    hence look markedly dissimilar) so the italic lower case comes
    from yet another tradition and looks different from upright
    forms. Italic upper case were a much later addition and are
    also based on the monumental capitals.</p>

    <p>The italic lower case is</p>

    <ul>
      <li>slanted -- this is extremely obvious (so obvious that
      when I compare upright and italic glyphs I always deslant the
      italic to make other differences more visible)</li>

      <li>condensed -- less obvious. Generally it will be condensed
      by about 90% which isn't noticeable unless you look hard.
      Stems may be condensed at a different percentage than
      counters (indeed, different stems may be condensed
      differently, but fontforge doesn't support that because I
      don't find any consistency in behavior to emulate).</li>

      <li>smaller x-height -- because a slanted line that reaches
      from baseline to a given height is longer than the
      corresponding vertical line, it will also appear (to the eye)
      to be slightly higher. To correct for this optical illusion,
      the x-height of an italic font will generally be a little
      lower than the xheight of its companion roman font. Note --
      if the xheight changes, you should adjust the BlueValues (and
      perhaps the FamilyBlues) with the <a href=
      "fontinfo.html#Private">Font Info dialog</a>.</li>

      <li>more flowing -- This may be extremely obvious<img src=
      "wItalic.png" width="68" height="24" />or more subtle -- in
      some fonts even the apparently straight sides of "l" will
      have a slight curve to them.</li>

      <li>different serifs -- The baseline serifs for the last stem
      on a glyph change <img src="BottomSerif.png" width="68"
      height="24" />, while those of intermediate stems become
      degenerate<img src="FlatSerif.png" width="49" height=
      "24" /></li>

      <li>different letterforms -- Some letters simply have
      different shapes in italic: <img src="fItalic.png" width="68"
      height="26" /><img src="aItalic.png" width="68" height=
      "24" /><img src="u433Italic.png" width="68" height=
      "24" /><img src="u432Italic.png" width="68" height=
      "24" /></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The italic upper case is also slanted (and by the same
    angle), generally condensed (but often less so than the lower
    case), and usually its serifs and letter forms do not change
    significantly (though there can be exceptions: <img src=
    "ucEItalic.png" width="68" height="24" />)</p>

    <p>In typographic tradition serifed fonts have a paired italic
    font, while sans-serif fonts have an oblique font.</p>

    <p><img src="ItalicDlg.png" width="406" height="715" align=
    "right" />The italic dialog attempts to give you control over
    as much of this as fontforge thinks it can do. The dialog
    displays the steps mentioned above, but backwards.</p>

    <p>First there are a series of check boxes for gross letterform
    changes. The "a" glyph generally turns into a something that
    looks like the "d" glyph without the ascender. The "f" glyph
    has (at least) two variants -- in one the curved top is
    duplicated at the bottom, and in the other the main stem is
    extended below the baseline but the serif is removed.</p>

    <p>In actual practice these changes are more complex. If
    examined closely the bottom part of the f doesn't look
    precisely like the top. FontForge isn't up to such subtleties
    however.</p>

    <p>The [] f checkboxes control additional characters which are
    similar to "f", "long-s" for example, also the "fi", "fl",
    "ff", "ffi", "ffl", "longs_longs", "longs_t", etc. ligatures.
    FontForge determines what glyphs it applies to by examining the
    glyph name and unicode encoding; it does NOT do a sophisticated
    analysis of the glyph's shape.</p>

    <p>This does not exhaust the list of changes that could or
    should be done -- Merely the list of what FontForge thinks it
    can do. There should also be checkboxes for: <img src=
    "eItalic.png" width="68" height="24" /><img src="vItalic.png"
    width="68" height="24" /><img src="wItalic.png" width="68"
    height="24" /><img src="u432Italic.png" width="68" height=
    "24" /><img src="u433Italic.png" width="68" height="24" /> and
    many more.</p>

    <p>FontForge will change serifs in various places.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>baseline serifs -- The final stem of a glyph almost
      always undergoes a serif transformation at the baseline.
      Previous stems generally have their serifs become degenerate
      (flat lines)<img src="mItalic.png" width="108" height=
      "31" />. This transformation almost always happens.</li>

      <li>xheight serifs -- This transformation frequently
      happens.</li>

      <li>ascender serifs -- This transformation happens
      occasionally. Sometimes the serif becomes very swash,
      somethings nothing changes.</li>

      <li>descender serifs -- Usually serifs on descenders
      degenerate into flat lines.</li>

      <li>diagonal serifs -- This transformation usually happens
      <img src="xItalic.png" width="68" height="24" /></li>
    </ul>

    <p>When a serif becomes degenerate (as the first two do in the
    "m" above) they often become flat with the baseline, but
    sometimes they will have a slant to them.</p>

    <p>Next is a matrix of compression factors (expressed as
    percentages). You can control left and right side bearings, as
    well as stem and counter widths. You may specify different
    values for lower case, upper case and symbols.</p>

    <p>Finally we come to the italic angle. This will generally be
    between -10 and -15 degrees.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><a name="Condense">Condense</a>/Extend dialog<img src=
    "CondenseExtend.png" width="321" height="193" align=
    "right" /></h2>

    <p>This dialog allows you to change counter sizes without
    changing stem sizes (in theory. It doesn't work too well with
    diagonal stems). You can make counters bigger or smaller by a
    percentage, or by adding a fixed amount to them.</p>

    <p>If the font has and Italic Angle specified in Font Info,
    then fontforge will first unskew the glyph in the hopes of
    getting some vertical stems, then Condense it, and the reskew
    it.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><a name="xheight">Change X-Height</a> dialog<img src=
    "ChangeXHeightDlg.png" align="right" width="258" height=
    "188" /></h2>

    <p>This changes the x-height of a font. The dialog shows the
    current x-height (or what it thinks is the current x-height),
    and you can chose an new value for it. If the font has serifs
    and you don't want the serifs to change in height then specify
    the current serif height. If you do want the serifs to change,
    then set this field to 0.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><a name="changeglyph">Change Glyphs</a> dialog<img src=
    "ChangeGlyph1Dlg.png" align="right" width="472" height=
    "242" /></h2>

    <p>The change glyphs dialog allows you to do a number of
    changes to all the currently selected glyphs. It can</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Increase or decrease the stem size (making the font
      bolder or less bold)</li>

      <li>Change the size of horizontal counters
      (Condense/Extend)</li>

      <li>Manipulate alignment zones with respect to one another
      (Change the x-height)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The dialog has three panes; each controls one of these
    funtions.</p>

    <p>The first dialog affects the stem width (or height, as the
    case may be). In most cases you will want to scale horizontal
    and vertical stems by the same proportion, so there is a check
    box to fix them together.</p>

    <p>Generally you will also want to control diagonal stems to,
    but there are still times when the algorithm is less than
    perfect.</p>

    <p>Generally a proportional scale is more appropriate than
    adding a fixed amount to each stem -- at least for Latin
    glyphs. But there may be cases where you do what to add a fixed
    amount.</p>

    <p>There are a few restrictions if you specify an additive
    amount here (again due to imperfections of the algorithm). The
    additive amounts must have the same sign for both horizontal
    and vertical stems (both negative, both zero, or both
    positive). And the ratio of the two can't be more than 4.</p>
    <hr />

    <p><img src="ChangeGlyph2Dlg.png" width="472" height="292"
    align="right" />You have various options for controlling
    horizontal contours. For monospace fonts (or CJK fonts) you
    probably want to select the first option. For proportional
    Latin fonts, select one of the other two.</p>
    <hr clear="all" />

    <p><img src="ChangeGlyph3Dlg.png" width="472" height="407"
    align="right" />Latin glyphs are asymetric in their behavior
    along the horizontal and vertical axes. Vertically glyphs are
    aligned at certain fixed heights (baseline, x-height,
    cap-height, etc.), while horizontally there are no
    corresponding alignment zones. So the vertical part of this
    dialog looks quite different from the horizontal.</p>

    <p>In CJK glyphs it may make sense to control vertical
    glyphs.</p>

    <p>But in latin it makes more sense to map alignment zones.
    Here there is a overall (default) scaling factor. If you don't
    adjust the zones yourself then changing the scale factor will
    change the "Resultant Y Position" by the obvious
    amount.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><a name="Smallcaps">Small Capitals</a> dialog<img src=
    "SmallcapsDlg.png" align="right" width="471" height=
    "318" /></h2>

    <p>This dialog allows you to create a series of small caps
    glyphs. As the dialog says, it is unlike most commands in that
    it does not change the selected glyphs, instead it uses them to
    decide what glyphs to create (or if the glyphs already exist,
    what glyphs to change).</p>

    <p>So if you select "A" FontForge will create a glyph named
    "a.sc" copy the outlines of "A" into that glyph, and then
    modify them. If you select lower case "a", FontForge will again
    create "a.sc" and will copy the outlines of upper case "A".</p>

    <p>FontForge will also create two lookups, one which maps upper
    case letters to small caps variants, and the other which maps
    lower case letters to the small caps glyph. These will be bound
    to the "c2sc" and "smcp" features respectively.</p>

    <p>OpenType supports two different variants of small caps, the
    normal small caps, and something called petite caps. Petite
    caps should be smaller than small caps (the example given in
    the opentype docs is for a font with a small x-height, small
    caps will be bigger than the x-height and petite caps will be
    at the x-height). Like small caps, there are two features for
    petite caps: "c2pc" and "pcap" (capital to petite caps and
    lowercase to petite caps).</p>

    <p>If you turn on the <code>[] Create small caps variants for
    symbols</code> checkbox, then any selected symbols will also be
    converted. However most symbols don't have upper and lower case
    variants (one could argue that digits do, but I shall ignore
    that complication here), so each selected symbol glyph will get
    both feature mappings attached to it. Furthermore, symbols seem
    to use a different glyph extension so the created glyphs will
    be "nine.taboldstyle" rather than "nine.sc".</p>

    <p>The default behavior is to transform the outlines by scaling
    the upper case outlines so that the cap height becomes the
    small cap height, and scaling the stems so that the upper case
    stem width becomes the lower case stem width. Often the small
    cap height will be a little taller than the x-height -- though
    the exact value will change from font to font -- the x-height
    is as good a default as any. If you do not like the default
    behavior you have all the options of the <a href=
    "#changeglyph">Change Glyphs</a> dialog to play with.</p>

    <p><span class="c3"><strong>Note:</strong></span> The default
    sizes are the same for both small caps and petite caps. If you
    want both features you will need to change settings for at
    least one of them!<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><a name="SubSuper">Subscipt</a>/Superscript dialog<img src=
    "SubSuperDlg.png" width="526" height="307" align=
    "right" /></h2>

    <p>There are several OpenType features which produce small
    variants of standard glyphs. Often the stems are scaled
    differently (made bolder) from the remainder of glyph.</p>

    <p>As with the previous dialog this one does not modify the
    selected glyphs. Instead it uses their outlines to create new
    glyphs (with the indicated glyph extension) and creates a
    lookup mapping the original glyph to the new glyph.</p>

    <p>So in the example at right, if you selected all the digits,
    then FontForge would create a new set of glyphs named
    "zero.superior", "one.superior" ... "nine.superior". It would
    create a new lookup bound to the feature "sups" which would map
    "zero" to "zero.superior", etc. By default each new glyph will
    be scaled down to be 2/3<sup>rd</sup>s the original size, but
    the stems would only be scaled by 3/4 (so the glyph will look
    proportionately darker). Finally each new glyph will be moved
    up by 450 em-units. Again if you don't like these defaults you
    have all the options of the <a href="#changeglyph">Change
    Glyphs</a> dialog to play with.<br clear="all" /></p>
