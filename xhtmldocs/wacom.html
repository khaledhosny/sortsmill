    <h1 class="c1">Wacom graphics tablets and FontForge</h1>

    <p>I have added support to FontForge for the wacom graphics
    tablet. Eventually I will write some drawing tools that depend
    on pressure (and tilt perhaps).</p>

    <p>To install a wacom tablet on your (linux) machine you must
    do two things:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Install a kernel module "wacom.o" into your system<br />
      Unfortunately the module which ships with linux (Nov 2002)
      does not work but John Joganic has <a href=
      "http://linuxwacom.sf.net/">an excellent website</a> that
      will help you install a working driver.</li>

      <li>Install an X11 driver "wacom_drv.o"<br />
      Again the X11 driver that ships with X does not work for USB
      tablets. Again John's website provides a patched driver.</li>
    </ul>
