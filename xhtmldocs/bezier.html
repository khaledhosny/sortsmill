    <p><img src="splines.gif" width="172" height="179" align=
    "left" />Technically PostScript uses cubic Bézier splines. Each
    control point determines the slope of the spline at the
    corresponding end point. TrueType uses quadratic Bézier
    splines, in these there is only one control point between two
    end points and that point determines the slope of the spline at
    both end points. Both formats also use lines (which are linear
    Bézier splines).</p>

    <p><img src="quadbezier.gif" width="113" height="88" align=
    "right" />It is also possible to have other degree Bézier
    splines. For a quartic spline there would be 3 control points,
    for a quintic 4 control points, etc. Of these only the linear,
    quadratic and cubic splines are interesting to us-- those used
    by TrueType and PostScript.</p>

    <p>The examples at left are cubic splines with two control
    points, each determining the slope at the nearest end point,
    while the example at right shows a quadratic spline with one
    control point used to determine the slopes at both end
    points.</p>

    <p>In general if there are n+1 points labeled P<sub>0</sub>,
    P<sub>1</sub>, ... P<sub>n</sub>, with P<sub>0</sub> and
    P<sub>n</sub> the end points (and all the others control
    points) then the equation of the Bézier spline between them is:
    <img src="bezier.gif" width="137" height="56" align=
    "middle" />. If there are two points then this is just the line
    between the two end points, if three then the quadratic spline
    used by TrueType, if four then the cubic spline used by
    PostScript.</p>

    <p>A cubic Bézier curve may be viewed as:</p>

    <blockquote>
      x = a<sub>x</sub>*t<sup>3</sup> + b<sub>x</sub>*t<sup>2</sup>
      + c<sub>x</sub>*t +d<sub>x</sub><br />
      y = a<sub>y</sub>*t<sup>3</sup> + b<sub>y</sub>*t<sup>2</sup>
      + c<sub>y</sub>*t +d<sub>y</sub>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Where</p>

    <table cellpadding="2">
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

        <td>d<sub>x</sub> = P0.x</td>

        <td>c<sub>x</sub> = 3*P1.x-3*P0.x</td>

    <h2>Converting <a name="ttf2ps" id="ttf2ps">TrueType to
    PostScript</a></h2>

    <p>Lines convert with no math whatsoever.</p>

    <p>Any quadratic spline can be expressed as a cubic (where the
    cubic term is zero). The end points of the cubic will be the
    same as the quadratic's.</p>

    <blockquote>
      CP<sub>0</sub> = QP<sub>0</sub><br />
      CP<sub>3</sub> = QP<sub>2</sub>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The two control points for the cubic are:</p>

    <blockquote>
      CP<sub>1</sub> = QP<sub>0</sub> + 2/3
      *(QP<sub>1</sub>-QP<sub>0</sub>)<br />
      CP<sub>2</sub> = QP<sub>2</sub> + 2/3
      *(QP<sub>1</sub>-QP<sub>2</sub>)
    </blockquote>

    <p>So converting from TrueType to PostScript is trivial. There
    is a slight error introduced due to rounding, but it is usually
    not noticeable.</p>

    <p>(Anish Mehta points out that in truetype it is possible to
    specify points which are in the middle of a pixel (ie. with an
    x or y value ending in 1/2). These will also introduce rounding
    errors when converted to postscript, but here the solution is
    simple: Scale the em-square of the font by a factor of 2 and
    the problem vanishes).</p>

    <h2>Converting <a name="ps2ttf" id="ps2ttf">PostScript to
    TrueType</a></h2>

    <p>Most cubic splines cannot be represented exactly by a
    quadratic (or even by a series of quadratics). The best that
    can be done is to approximate the cubic to within some margin
    of error. Here is a way to do that:</p>

    <p>Given a cubic spline. Look at two points on the spline. Then
    there is only one possible quadratic spline between those two
    points which has the desired slope at those two points. (the
    one quadratic has its end points as the end points of the
    interval, and its control point is determined by the
    intersections of the lines tangent to the cubic at the start
    and end of the interval).</p>

    <p><img src="cubic2quad.png" width="482" height="180" align=
    "right" />I cannot prove this, but have determined empirically
    (after being told it worked) that if a cubic spline -- like the
    quarter ellipse at right -- is divided "evenly" into n
    quadratic splines (here n==3) then the control points will have
    the nice property that the on-curve points are exactly mid-way
    between control points -- this means that truetype can
    represent them as interpolated points. An even division means
    means that each sub-point is placed where t=i/n (where
    0&lt;i&lt;n).</p>

    <p>FontForge first checks to see if the curve is already a
    quadratic -- this might happen if the cubic originally came
    from a truetype font. If it is it simply converts the control
    point.</p>

    <p>Otherwise FontForge start inserting points. It begins by
    inserting a single point mid-way on the spline. If this
    produces a good approximation it stops, otherwise it tries
    again with two, three ... additional points.</p>

    <p>On each test it will round the control points to integer
    values because truetype output requires this (note that it does
    not do this to the on-curve points, they are interpolated
    between control points and will be ok if the control points
    are). Then it checks to see if the resultant quadratics are
    close to the original curve.</p>

    <p>FontForge may also break the curve at its points of
    inflection (because no quadratic can have one there should be a
    point there to start a new quadratic) and apply the above
    algorithm to the components.</p>

    <p>If FontForge can find no good approximation using the above
    algorithm it will fall back to its old method, which is:</p>

    <p>Start from the end of the spline and every so often (ie.
    within the margin of error) check to see if the one permissible
    quadratic approximation actually matches the cubic closely
    enough .</p>

    <p>If this approximation works then keep it as part of the
    result, and continue the process by advancing our start point
    along to the cubic spline to the end of the quadratic we just
    created.</p>

    <p>(There are some slight complexities introduced because there
    may not be a quadratic approximation at a given point (if the
    tangents happen to be parallel) or because the approximation
    happens to be linear, but these are easily dealt with).</p>

    <p>It may, of course, happen that the "cubic" we are given is
    actually a quadratic (if its third degree term is 0), the most
    likely cause is that the font came from a truetype source. In
    that case the control point for the quadratic is at:</p>

    <blockquote>
      QP<sub>1</sub> = CP<sub>0</sub> + 3/2 * (CP<sub>1</sub> -
      CP<sub>0</sub>)
    </blockquote>

    <p>Other sources I have read on the net suggest checking the
    cubic spline for points of inflection (which quadratic splines
    cannot have) and forcing breaks there. To my eye this actually
    makes the result worse, it uses more points and the
    approximation does not look as close as it does when ignoring
    the points of inflection. So I ignore them.</p>

    <h2>Open Type, another solution</h2>

    <p>Adobe and Microsoft decided to produce one font format which
    could hold either a true type font or a postscript font. This
    is called Open Type. It is essentially a superset of TrueType.
    Any TrueType font is a valid Open Type font, but Open Type
    fonts can also contain postscript. Anything that supports Open
    Type will not require converting between PostScript and True
    Type.</p>
