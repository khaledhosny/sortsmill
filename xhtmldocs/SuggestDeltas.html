  <p>After you have generated truetype instructions to grid fit a
  glyph it might to useful to look at places where those
  instructions yield questionable results. In truetype a pixel is
  turned on if the center point of that pixel is within the curve.
  If the curve is extremely close to the center point then results
  are questionable</p>

  <ol>
    <li>You might want it on the other side</li>

    <li>Another rasterizer might round things differently and place
    the curve on the wrong side.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><img src="QGDlg.png" width="356" height="280" align=
  "right" />So it might be helpful to have a command which would
  search the glyph for places and pixelsizes where splines are
  close to the center points of pixels.</p>

  <p>TrueType has an instruction called DELTA which allows you to
  move points only at certain pixelsizes.</p>

  <p>The dialog opposite will check the glyph at pointsizes 7-40,
  72, 80, ... where the screen resolution is 100 for places where a
  spline comes within .01 (in pixel units) of the center of a
  pixel.</p>

  <p><img src="QGList.png" width="441" height="376" align=
  "left" />The results will look like those at right. Clicking on
  an entry will toggle whether that entry is open (and its children
  visible) or not.</p>

  <p><img src="JustOutside.png" width="132" height="210" align=
  "right" />If you click on one of the bottom level entries then
  fontforge will open a glyph view on that glyph, rasterize it at
  the current pointsize and resolution, and indicate the offending
  pixel by drawing a red box around it. As you can see, the pixel
  center point lies almost exactly on the spline. The closest real
  point is the control point #8.</p>

  <p>It is possible to reorder the list... depending on what is
  most important. At right data are organized by glyph, size and
  point. It might also be useful to see which points in a glyph are
  close to problems.</p>
