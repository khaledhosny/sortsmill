    <h1 class="c1">The Mac State Machine Dialog</h1>

    <p><img src="statemachine-context.png" width="490" height="566"
    align="right" />The mac uses state machines where opentype
    would use a contextual lookup. The example at right (with
    appropriate substitutions attached to it) will convert an
    initial or medial short-s into a long-s (for doing renaissance
    printing).</p>

    <p>FontForge currently supports 4 types of state machines:
    contextual glyph substitution, indic rearrangement, contextual
    glyph insertion, and contextual kerning. The example at right
    is of contextual glyph substitution.</p>

    <p>An example conditional substitution state machine is
    provided in the <a href=
    "editexample6-5.html#Apple">tutorial</a>.</p>

    <p>On the mac there are four predefined classes, one meaning
    the end of input, one for all glyphs not specified elsewhere,
    one for the magic "deleted" glyph (Apple does not always delete
    a glyph when asked to do so, instead it retains a special mark
    in the glyph stream indicating that the glyph should be deleted
    later), and finally a class for the end of a line of text. Any
    classes after this are user defined. In the example at right
    there are many user defined classes representing various
    groupings of arabic letters. Any other glyphs in the font (the
    digits for example) will automatically be assigned to class 1
    ("{Everything Else}").</p>

    <p>The state machine itself is shown as a two dimensional
    matrix of transitions, one transition for every state and
    class. Classes are shown at the top of the matrix, and states
    down the side. The transition from state 0 when given input
    from class 0 is shown in the upper left corner of the matrix,
    and so on.</p>

    <p>When the state machine starts up it will be in one of the
    first two states. It will be in state 0 at the beginning of
    input, and in state1 when it starts at the beginning of a new
    line.</p>

    <p>The <a name="transitions" id="transitions">transitions</a>
    look slightly differently depending on the type of state
    machine:</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="2">
      <tr>
        <th>Indic</th>

        <th>Contextual</th>

        <th>Insertion</th>

        <th>Kerning</th>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p class="c2"><img src="transition-indic.png" width="54"
          height="64" /></p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p class="c2"><img src="transition-context.png" width=
          "54" height="64" /></p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p class="c2"><img src="transition-insert.png" width="54"
          height="64" /></p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p class="c2"><img src="transition-kern.png" width="54"
          height="64" /></p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The first line of all transitions shows the next state. The
    next line contains a set of flags where "M" =&gt; the current
    glyph should be marked (the meaning of this becomes apparent
    later), "A" =&gt; processing should advance to the next glyph.
    For indic tables there is a third flag shown, "L" =&gt; the
    current glyph is the last glyph of the indic rearrangement,
    while for kerning tables there is a "P" flag indicating that
    the current glyph should be pushed onto the kerning stack.</p>

    <p>The last two lines have varied meanings depending on the
    type of the state machine.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>For Indic transitions the two lines should be appended to
      get the indic rearrangement verb (in the example above that
      would be "Ax =&gt; xA" meaning that the first glyph marked
      should be moved after the last glyph marked)</li>

      <li>For contextual transitions the two lines specify the
      lookup names of simple substitutions. The first one is
      applied to the last glyph marked and the second one to the
      current glyph (if a line is blank, no substitution is applied
      to that glyph here).<br />
      If a transition has both a "marked substitution" and the
      "mark current glyph" flag, I believe the substitution applies
      to the glyph that was previously marked, and not to the
      current glyph. (Apple doesn't document this)<span class=
      "c3"><br />
      <strong>Caveat:</strong></span> Apple's 'mort' format was not
      designed to allow fonteditors to figure out what a state
      machine did. FontForge can usually make a good guess of what
      substitutions do which apply to the current glyph, but it
      will often include extraneous glyph substitutions when a
      substitution applies to a marked glyph. These should not be
      harmful (they should never get invoked) but they are annoying
      ('morx' tables should not have this problem).</li>

      <li>For insertion transitions the lines specify the glyphs
      that are to be inserted. The first line applies to the marked
      glyph, the second line to current glyph (there may not be
      room enough to show all the inserted glyphs, in which case
      the glyph list is truncated). There are additional flags here
      that are also not shown because of lack of room. They may be
      viewed by clicking on a transition.</li>

      <li>For kerning transitions the first line shows the first
      (few) kerning values, the second line shows either "..." if
      there are more kerning values, or nothing.<br />
      Note: The number of kerning values <span class=
      "c3"><strong>MUST</strong></span> match the number of glyphs
      pushed on the kern stack, or your application crashes.</li>
    </ul>

    do you should read Apple's documentation</p>

    </ul>

    <p>The general idea is that a word processor converts text into
    a string of glyphs, and then the state machine is applied to
    that string. The state machine starts in state 0 or 1, it
    figures out what class the first glyph belongs to, and indexes
    into the current state by that class. The transition at that
    location provides a new state to move to (which might be the
    same as the current one), it will usually advance to the next
    glyph (so the new state will be indexed by a different glyph)
    but sometimes you will want to continue processing the current
    glyph in the new state. Also it will perform a set of
    operations which differ depending on the type of state
    machine.</p>

    <p>Many of the state machines have the concept of a "marked"
    glyph. This is important if the desired change for a given
    glyph depends on what glyphs follow it. In that case when we
    reach an interesting glyph we "mark" it, and then, after
    reading a few more glyphs when we know what to do, we apply a
    transformation to the marked glyph.</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="2">
      <tr>
        <th>Indic</th>

        <th>Contextual</th>

        <th>Insertion</th>

        <th>Kerning</th>
      </tr>

      <tr valign="top">
        <td>
          <p class="c4">In addition to a "mark"ed glyph, indic
          transformations also have a the concept of a "last"
          glyph. There are 16 transformations which may be applied
          the the glyphs between the "mark"ed and "last" glyphs.
          Suppose the glyph stream looks like<br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; abcdef<br />
          And "a" was "mark"ed and "d" was "last" then a transition
          "AxD =&gt; DxA" refers to the marked glyph as "A", the
          last glyph as "D" and everything in between as "x", so
          this would change the glyph stream to<br />
          &nbsp; &nbsp; dbcaef</p>
        </td>

        <td>This can apply a substitution to the current glyph, a
        different substitution to the marked glyph, and it may mark
        the current glyph. The substitutions are indicated by 4
        character tags and should be "Nested" substitutions which
        may be created by the Element-&gt;Char Info dialog.</td>

        <td>This can insert a string (up to 31 glyphs) before or
        after the current and the marked glyphs.</td>

        <td>Kerning does not have a single "mark"ed glyph, instead
        it can push up to 8 glyphs onto a stack, and at a later
        point a set of kerning values may be applied to those
        glyphs (so the flag which is usually indicated as "M" for
        mark, is here "P" for push). Once all the glyphs have been
        pushed, a set of kerning values may be applied. One value
        for each pushed glyph. This is a number which indicates how
        much the glyph in question should be kerned. If the glyph
        stream looks like:<br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; F."<br />
        and you want to kern "." by -300, and """ by 0 em-units,
        then you would enter<br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; -300 0<br />
        as kerning values.</td>
      </tr>
