    <h2><a name="checking" id="checking">Checking</a> a font</h2>

    <p>After you have finished making all the glyphs in your font
    you should check it for inconsistencies. FontForge has a
    command, <a href="problems.html">Element-&gt;Find Problems</a>
    which is designed to find many common problems.</p>

    <p>Simply select all the glyphs in the font and then bring up
    the Find Problems dialog. Be warned though: Not everything it
    reports as a problem is a real problem, some may be an element
    of the font's design that FontForge does not expect.</p>

    <p>The dialog can search for problems like:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Stems which are close to but not exactly some standard
      value.</li>

      <li>Points which are close to but not exactly some standard
      height</li>

      <li>Paths which are almost but not quite vertical or
      horizontal</li>

      <li>Control points which are in unlikely places</li>

      <li>Points which are almost but not quite on a hint</li>

      <li>...</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I find it best just to check for a similar problems at a
    time, otherwise switching between different kinds of problems
    can be distracting.</p>

    <h2><a name="Bitmaps" id="Bitmaps">Bitmaps</a></h2>

    <p>At this point you might want some bitmaps to go with the
    outline font (this is not compulsory). Go to
    <code>Element-&gt;Bitmap Strikes Available</code> and select
    the pixel sizes you want bitmaps in (Note, that on X and MS
    windows pixel sizes often do not correspond exactly to point
    sizes. You can then use the bitmap editor (<code><a href=
    "bitmapview.html">Window-&gt;Open Bitmap</a></code>) to clean
    up the bitmaps, or you can generate your bitmap fonts and then
    <a href="http://clr.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/download.html">use
    someone else's bitmap editor to clean them up</a>.</p>

    <p><img src="BitmapView.png" width="254" height="273" /></p>

    <p>Bitmaps are discussed in more detail in the <a href=
    "editexample8.html">next section.</a></p>

    <h2><a name="generating" id="generating">Generating</a> a
    font</h2>

    <p>If you save your file it will be saved in a format that only
    FontForge understands (as far as I know anyway). This is not
    very helpful if you want to use the font.</p>

    <p><img src="generate.png" width="406" height="411" align=
    "right" />Instead you must use <a href=
    "generate.html">File-&gt;Generate</a> to convert your font into
    one of the standard font formats. FontForge presents what looks
    like a vast array of font formats, but in reality there are
    just several variants on a few basic font formats: PostScript
    Type 1, TrueType, OpenType (and for CJK fonts, also CID-keyed
    fonts).</p>

    <p>You also have a choice of bitmap formats. FontForge supports
    bdf (used by X), mac NFNT (used by the Mac), Windows FNT (used
    by Windows 2.0 I think) and storing bitmaps inside true (or
    open) type wrappers.<br clear="right" /></p>

    <h2>Font <a name="Families" id="Families">Families</a></h2>

    <p>After you have generated a font, you probably want to
    generate a sequence of similar fonts. In Latin, Greek and
    Cyrillic fonts italic (or oblique), bold, condensed, expanded
    styles are fairly common.</p>

    <p>Fonts with different styles in the same family should share
    the same Family Name (in the <a href=
    "fontinfo.html">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Names</a> dialog).
    The Font Name should be the Family Name with the style name(s)
    appended to the end, often preceded by a hyphen. So in the font
    family "Helvetica" all fonts should have the Family Name set to
    "Helvetica". The plain style could be called simply "Helvetica"
    or "Helvetica-Regular", the bold style "Helvetica-Bold", the
    oblique (Helvetica doesn't have a true italic)
    "Helvetica-Oblique", etc.</p>

    <p>FontForge has a menu <a href=
    "elementmenu.html#Style">Element-&gt;Style</a> which is
    designed to help you create different styles (bold, italic,
    oblique, condensed, extended, smallcaps,...) of a font a plain
    face. None of these transformations is perfect, be sure to
    check the results.</p>

    <p>The <a href=
    "transform.html">Element-&gt;Transform-&gt;Transform-&gt;Skew</a>
    command can turn a plain font into an Oblique one. Creating a
    true italic font is generally a bit more complex, the shape of
    the "a" changes dramatically to "<i>a</i>", the "f" gains a
    descender as "<i>f</i>", the serifs on "ilm" etc. become
    rounded as "<i>ilm</i>" and there will probably be other subtle
    differences. Also, after having skewed a font you should
    <a href="elementmenu.html#Add-Extrema">Element-&gt;Add
    Extrema</a>.</p>

    <p>If you already have a "Bold" and a "Plain" style of a font
    (and each glyph has the same number of points in the same
    order), you can use the <a href=
    "elementmenu.html#Interpolate">Element-&gt;Interpolate Font</a>
    command to generate a "DemiBold" style.</p>

    <p>TrueType fonts (and Windows) support a very fine gradation
    of stem thicknesses (the Mac really only understands Plain and
    Bold). If you go to <a href=
    "fontinfo.html#TTF-Values">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;OS/2</a>
    you can set the weight to be any value between 0 and 999 (with
    plain generally being at 400 or 500, and Bold at 700). TrueType
    fonts also support a range of widths (while the Mac only
    supports condensed, plain and expanded).</p>

    <p><img src="GenerateFamily.png" width="414" height="552" alt=
    "Dialog for Generate Mac Family" align="right" />On Windows
    machines, as long as you get the names right, the system should
    be able to figure out what fonts go into what families. But on
    the Mac the situation is (or was, it is changing and I don't
    understand all the new extensions yet) more complicated. The
    Mac supports a limited range of styles (plain, italic, bold,
    outline, condensed, expanded and combinations of these)
    anything outside these must go into a separate family. Then a
    special table needs to be constructed (called the FOND) which
    holds pointers to the various fonts in the family. If you open
    all the fonts you want to be in a given family (and if they
    have been given the proper names) and then from the plain font
    select <a href="filemenu.html#GenerateMac">File-&gt;Generate
    Family</a>. This will list all the fonts that FontForge thinks
    belong to the same family as the current font and will allow
    you to generate a FOND structure as well as font files for all
    family members (sometimes all the fonts live in one file,
    sometimes they don't, it depends on the font format
    chosen).</p>

    <h2><a name="summary" id="summary">Final</a> Summary</h2>

    <p>So you have made a new font. But it does you no good just
    sitting on your disk, you must install it on your machine. On
    some systems this is as simple as just dragging the new font
    into your system Fonts folder, but on other systems there is a
    fair amount work involved still. See the <a href=
    "faq.html#font-install">Installing fonts FAQ</a>.</p>
