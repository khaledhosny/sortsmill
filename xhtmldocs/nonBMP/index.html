  <title>non BMP unicode bitmap fonts supported by
  FontForge</title>

  <p>Ironically, FontForge is stuck in the dark ages when it comes
  to using fonts. It should be using libXft and gtk to get full
  unicode support.</p>

  <p>It doesn't. It continues to use the old X bitmap interface
  which the X consortium isn't interested in extending beyond BMP
  (since libXft/gtk do this well and there is no point in redoing
  that for an obsolete interface).</p>

  <p>But I'd like to draw non-BMP characters at least in my font
  view.</p>

  <p>To this end I have made FontForge recognize some non-standard
  encodings: -*-*-*-*-*--*-*-*-*-*-*-UnicodePlane-{1,2,3,...16}</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
-fontforge-planeone-medium-r-normal--13-120-75-75-p-101-unicodeplane-1
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Is a font that fontforge will interpret as containing glyphs
  from plane 1 (Supplementary Multilingual Plane) -- starting with
  Linear B glyphs.</p>

  <p>As a proof of concept I've created a bdf font containing all
  the Linear B syllables, and not much of anything else (I am aware
  that the CODE200? fonts provide good glyphs for the non-bmp
  characters, but they are shareware so I can't just rasterize them
  and redistribute them).</p>

  <p>If anyone would like to submit glyphs to this font (or to
  putative similar ones for planes 2&amp;14) I'll try and
  coordinate that process.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="PlaneOne.sfd.bz2">PlaneOne.sfd</a></li>

    <li><a href="PlaneOne-13.bdf.bz2">PlaneOne-13.bdf</a></li>

    <li><a href="toplane.c.bz2">toplane.c</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The sfd file is encoded with a "full unicode" encoding. The
  program toplane.c will take a bdf containing one Unicode plane,
  figure out which plane it is, and reencode the font with the
  appropriate UnicodePlane mapping.</p>
