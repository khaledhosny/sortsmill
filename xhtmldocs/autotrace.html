    <h1 class="c1">Autotracing bitmaps in FontForge</h1>

    <p>FontForge does not have a native autotrace, but it will
    happily use the output of two freely available programs which
    do autotracing. These are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Peter Selinger's <a href=
      "http://potrace.sf.net/">potrace</a></li>

      <li>Martin Weber's <a href=
      "http://sourceforge.net/projects/autotrace/">autotrace
      program</a><br />
      <span class="c2"><strong>CAVEAT:</strong></span> Autotrace
      2.8 changed its argument conventions (around Dec 2001). New
      versions (after 15 Dec) of fontforge will not work with
      autotrace2.7, old versions of fontforge will not work with
      autotrace2.8. I see no way to make fontforge work with both
      or to detect the current version...<br />
      <span class="c2"><strong>CAVEAT2:</strong></span> I may not
      be loading the results of autotrace properly in all cases (I
      do in my test cases, of course). AutoTrace traces out both
      foreground and background regions, so I may sometimes leave
      behind a lump which represents a background area. Just delete
      it if it happens (and send me the image so I can fix things
      up).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You must download at least one of these, (and possibly build
    it), and install it somewhere along your PATH.</p>

    <p>Having done that you must get an image into the background
    of the glyph(s) you want to autotrace. There are several ways
    of doing this:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>From a bitmap font</dt>

      <dd>
        If you want to autotrace a bitmap font then (from the
        FontView)

        <ul>
          <li>(You will probably want to start out with a new font,
          but you might not)</li>

          <li>File-&gt;Import</li>

          <li>select the bitmap font type (bdf, FON, embedded in a
          ttf file, TeX bitmap (GF, PK), etc.)</li>

          <li>turn on the <code>[*] As Background</code> flag</li>

          <li>Select your font file</li>

          <li>This should place the bitmaps into the background of
          the glyphs in the font. Nothing will be visible in the
          font view, but if you open up an outline glyph view, you
          should see the bitmap version of the glyph as a grey
          background.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt>From the clipboard</dt>

      <dd>If you have an application that supports sending image
      selections by mime type (kde does this), then you should be
      able to copy the image in that application and paste it into
      the appropriate glyph window in FontForge</dd>

      <dt>From an image file</dt>

      <dd>
        If you have a bitmap in an image (it works best if it IS a
        black and white bitmap image, rather than a color image)

        <ul>
          <li>Open up an outline glyph view for the appropriate
          glyph</li>

          <li>Make the Background layer active (this is usually not
          necessary)</li>

          <li>File-&gt;Import</li>

          <li>select Format=Image (this will show you any image
          format that fontforge supports)</li>

          <li>Select your file</li>

          <li>The image should now be visible in the background of
          this glyph</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt>From multiple image files</dt>

      <dd>
        If you have many images, you can load them with one
        command, but you must name them appropriately. For example
        if your font contains unicode characters U+0041 (LATIN
        CAPITAL LETTER A) through U+0049 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER J)
        then create files called "uni0041.png", "uni0042.png", ...
        "uni0049.png" containing the images for the appropriate
        characters, then (from the Font View)

        <ul>
          <li>Select the requisite glyphs</li>

          <li>File-&gt;Import</li>

          <li>select Format=Image template</li>

          <li>select the first of your images, "uni0041.png"</li>

          <li>This should load all images that match that template
          ("uni*.png") into the appropriate glyph slot</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Once you have background images in your font (and have
    installed an autotrace program)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Select all the glyphs you wish to autotrace</li>

      <li>Element-&gt;Autotrace</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This can take a while, so be patient.</p>

    <p><span class="c2"><strong>Warning:</strong></span> Unless you
    are working with a TeX bitmap font, you will most likely have
    an extremely low resolution image. Autotrace programs work
    better the more resolution you give them.</p>

    <p>If you hold down the shift key when you invoke AutoTrace
    from the menu then you will be prompted for arguments to pass
    to it, if you do not hold down the shift key FontForge will use
    the same arguments it used last time. AutoTrace's arguments are
    described in "$ autotrace -help" or in the README file that
    came with the program. Please do not specify input/output files
    or formats. FontForge fills these in.</p>
