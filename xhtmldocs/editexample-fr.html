    <p>If you wish to follow along with the tutorial, <a href=
    "tutorial.tgz">this bundle</a> should provide you with the
    basic files you need.</p>

    <h2><a name="FontCreate" id="FontCreate">Font creation</a></h2>

    <p>First create a new font with the <code>New</code> command in
    the <code>File</code> menu (or by using the <kbd>-new</kbd>
    argument at startup).</p>

    <p><img src="newfont.png" width="419" height="189" /></p>

    <p>Give the font a name with the <code><a href=
    "fontinfo.html">Font Info</a></code> command from the
    <code>Element</code> menu. You use this same command to change
    the encoding (ie what characters are available in the font),
    set the copyright message and change the ascent and descent
    (the sum of these two determines the size of the em square for
    the font, and by convention is 1000 for postscript fonts, a
    power of two (often 2048 or 4096) for truetype fonts and 15,000
    for Ikarus fonts).</p>

    <p><img src="fontinfo.png" width="376" height="544" /></p>

    <h2><a name="CharCreate" id="CharCreate">Creating a
    character</a></h2>

    <p>Once you have done that you are ready to start editing
    characters. Double click on the entry for "C" in the font view
    above. You should now have an empty Outline Character
    window:</p>

    <p><img src="C1.png" width="272" height="283" /></p>

    <p>Select the Import command from the File menu and import an
    image of the character you are creating. It will be scaled so
    that it is as high as the em-square.</p>

    <p><img src="C2.png" width="272" height="283" /></p>

    <p>Select the background layer as editable from the layers
    palette, move the mouse pointer to one of the edges of the
    image, hold down the shift key, depress and drag the corner
    until the image is a reasonable size, then move the pointer
    onto the dark part of the image, depress the mouse and drag
    until the image is properly positioned.</p>

    <p><img src="C3.png" width="272" height="283" /></p>

    <p>If you have downloaded the <a href=
    "http://sourceforge.net/projects/autotrace/">autotrace
    program</a> you can invoke <code>Element-&gt;AutoTrace</code>
    to generate an outline from the image. But if you have not you
    must add points yourself. Change the active layer to be the
    foreground, and go to the tools palette and select the round
    (or curve) point. Then move the pointer to the edge of the
    image and add a point. I find that it is best to add points at
    places where the curve is horizontal or vertical, at corners,
    or where the curve changes inflection (A change of inflection
    occurs in a curve like "S" where the curve changes from being
    open to the left to being open on the right. If you follow
    these rules hinting will work better.</p>

    <p><img src="C4.png" width="272" height="283" /></p>

    <p>It is best to enter a curve in a clockwise fashion, so the
    next point should be added up at the top of the image on the
    flat section. Because the shape becomes flat here, a curve
    point is not appropriate, rather a tangent point is (this looks
    like a little triangle on the tools palette). A tangent point
    makes a nice transition from curves to straight lines because
    the curve leaves the point with the same slope the line had
    when it entered.</p>

    <p><img src="C5.png" width="272" height="283" /></p>

    <p>At the moment this "curve" doesn't match the image at all,
    don't worry about that we'll fix it later, and anyway it will
    change on its own as we continue. Note that we now have a
    control point attached to the tangent point (the little blue
    x). The next point needs to go where the image changes
    direction abruptly. Neither a curve nor a tangent point is
    appropriate here, instead we must use a corner point (one of
    the little squares on the tools palette).</p>

    <p><img src="C6.png" width="272" height="283" /></p>

    <p>As you see the old curve now follows the image a bit more
    closely. We continue adding points until we are ready to close
    the path.</p>

    <p><img src="C7.png" width="272" height="283" /></p>

    <p>Then we close the path just by adding a new point on top of
    the old start point</p>

    <p><img src="C8.png" width="272" height="283" /></p>

    <p>Now we must make the curve track the image more closely, to
    do this we must adjust the control points (the blue "x"es). To
    make all the control points visible select the pointer tool and
    double-click on the curve and then move the control points
    around until the curve looks right.</p>

    <p><img src="C9.png" width="266" height="279" /></p>

    <p>Finally we set width. Again with the pointer tool, move the
    mouse to the width line on the right edge of the screen,
    depress and drag the line back to a reasonable location.</p>

    <p><img src="C10.png" width="266" height="279" /></p>

    <p>And we are done with this character.</p>

    <p>Well sort of. If you are like me you didn't get everything
    quite right even though you checked. You can use
    Element-&gt;<a href="problems.html">Find Problems</a>... to
    check for simple mistakes (like having your vertical lines be
    slightly skewed).</p>

    <p>You can use <code>View-&gt;Next Char</code> and
    <code>View-&gt;Prev Char</code> to look at additional
    characters.</p>

    <p>Most modern fonts will contain accented characters. Accented
    characters are easy to make once you have made the accents and
    base characters they depend on. For example if you have created
    the "C" character and the "cedilla" then you can scroll the
    font view until you can see the "Ccedilla" character, then
    select it and use Element-&gt;<a href="accented.html">Build
    Accented Char</a> to create the accented glyph.</p>

    <p>Of course you can also do this manually. Another way is to
    select the "C" character and do Edit-&gt;Copy Reference, then
    select the "Ccedilla" character and Edit-&gt;Paste, select the
    "cedilla" character and Edit-&gt;Copy Reference, select the
    "Ccedilla" character again, and open it up by double clicking
    on it, and then doing Edit-&gt;Paste. You will probably have to
    adjust the cedilla until it snuggles properly under the C.</p>

    <p>When you have created all your accents you have created your
    first font.</p>

    <p>One of the hardest tasks of all is getting to spaces around
    the characters to look nice. FontForge has a <code><a href=
    "autowidth.html#AutoWidth">Metrics-&gt;Auto Width</a></code>
    command which attempts to guess reasonable values for the
    character spacings in your font. Just select the "All" radio
    button in both sets of buttons and press OK.<br />
    <i><img src="autowidth.png" width="276" height="268" /></i></p>

    <p>At this point you might want some bitmaps to go with the
    postscript (this is not compulsory). Go to
    <code>Element-&gt;Bitmaps Available</code> and select the pixel
    sizes you want bitmaps in (Note, that on X and MS windows pixel
    sizes often do not correspond exactly to point sizes. You can
    then use the bitmap editor (<code>File-&gt;Open Bitmap</code>)
    to clean up the bitmaps, or you can generate your bitmap fonts
    and then <a href=
    "http://clr.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/download.html">use someone
    else's bitmap editor to clean them up</a>.</p>

    <p><img src="BitmapView.png" width="254" height="273" /></p>

    <p>Last of all you can generate font files. Select
    <code>File-&gt;Generate Fonts</code>, select the outline font
    format, and which (if any) of your bitmaps you want converted
    into a bitmap font.</p>
