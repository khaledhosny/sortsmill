    <p>All programs crash, and new programs (like this one) crash a
    lot.</p>

    <p>Every minute or so FontForge looks around and sees if
    anything has changed since the last time it checked. If it
    finds a font that has had changes, it will save a small file in
    its private directory (~/.FontForge/autosave) which consists of
    all changed glyphs in the changed font.</p>

    <p>When FontForge starts up it checks this directory, and if it
    finds anything there it attempts to apply those changes to the
    original font. So if FontForge crashes, or if your machine
    crashes, the next time you start FontForge it will figure out
    what you were doing and recover it as best it can.</p>

    <p>When editing CID-keyed fonts there are a few potential
    gotchas:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>FontForge does not keep track of gross changes (like
      adding or removing a sub font)</li>

      <li>FontForge does not keep track of which sub font a change
      occurred in, instead at recovery time it will look for a
      subfont that is contains a glyph at the CID that was changed.
      In almost all cases this will be right, but if you add glyphs
      or if you have two sub-fonts defining the same CID, FontForge
      may guess wrong.</li>
    </ul>
