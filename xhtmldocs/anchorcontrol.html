    <h1 class="c1">The Anchor Control dialog</h1>

    <p><img src="anchorcontrol-base.png" width="501" height="323"
    align="right" />You invoke this dialog from the outline glyph
    view by selecting an anchor point in that glyph and selecting
    <code>Metrics-&gt;Anchor Control</code>. In the example at
    right, the arabic letter Hamza was chosen. In the first pane of
    the dialog are various controls, next to that is a pane
    displaying the letter Hamza and showing the anchor point
    relative to that letter. You may move the anchor point around
    to position it as you wish.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <p>After this there is a scrollable region containing multiple
    sub-panes. Each sub-pane contains one combination of Hamza and
    a mark that fits on top of it. If you click in one of these
    sub-panes, FontForge changes the dialog to look at the mark you
    selected.<img src="anchorcontrol-mark.png" width="501" height=
    "323" align="left" /> Here we clicked on the Fathatan mark, and
    we now see all the base letters that fit underneath it. This
    dialog now gives you control of the anchor point in the
    Fathatan mark.</p>

    <p>At the top of the control region is a pull down list
    containing the names of all glyphs in this anchor class. You
    may look at the combinations based on any of them. You may also
    use the Page Up and Page Down keys to cycle through this
    list.</p>

    <p>You may control the pixelsize used to display the
    combinations. Sometimes it is important to get a close up view
    of a small pixelsize (which may be quite different from looking
    at a larger pixelsize) and the Magnification field allows for
    this.</p>

    <p>You can also enter the anchor point's location by manual
    typing in the X,Y textfields at right.</p>

    <h2>Device Tables</h2>

    <p>You can also create something called a "<a name=
    "DeviceTable" id="DeviceTable">Device Table</a>", a name which
    is not very informative. When a font is rasterized at small
    pixel sizes rounding errors become important, and this is
    particularly true of mark positioning, where there are four
    things that get rounded: The locations of the each glyph's
    outlines (to fit them to a pixel grid), and the locations of
    the anchor points of each glyph. The result is that something
    which looks perfectly positioned at 150pixels may be either too
    close or too far apart at 12pixels.</p>

    <p>You could adjust the anchor point's location slightly until
    it looked right at 12pixels, of course, but that might break it
    at 14 pixels. So OpenType has the concept of a Device Table
    which allows you to add small corrections at particular point
    sizes. Simply set the Size to a small, but common, value (say
    10-24) and examine the positioning. If the results are ugly
    then type a value into the appropriate
    <code>Cor</code>(rection) field, and this will change the
    spacing by that many pixels at the given display size (and no
    other).</p>

    <p>Note it may sometimes be better to define a correction in
    the matching glyph rather than the current one. Corrections
    will apply to all glyphs matched with the current one.</p>
