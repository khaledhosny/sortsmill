  <p>This dialog allows you to control the look and feel of
  FontForge. You can control (most of) the same resources described
  in the <a href="xres.html">X Resource page</a>, but in (I hope) a
  more convenient format. Some changes will be reflected instantly,
  other changes require refreshing the screen, other changes
  require invoking a new dialog, and some changes you must save the
  resources and restart fontforge.</p>

  <p>To the left of the dialog is a list of all fontforge's
  controls (and some other stuff). Every control is drawn within a
  box, and the box specifies a background, border, shape, size...
  Many controls have an associated font. Most controls inherit much
  of their design from other controls (The GGadget, which is an
  abstract control, is the root of the hierarchy). A particular
  attribute may be inherited from its parent, or it may be defined
  by the current control.</p>

  <p>Other controls may depend on the current one, changes to the
  current control may affect those others if the attribute changed
  is inherited.</p>

  <p>The top of the pane identifies the current control, and
  describes the parent of the current control (you may click on the
  "Inherits from" entry to change the pane to view that control).
  Often there are some examples of the control, generally an
  enabled and disabled version.</p>

  <p>Beneath this are the actual data. First the data describing
  the box. There are a series of flags</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Outline Inner Border</dt>

    <dd>A line (in the text color) will be drawn on the inside of
    the border to make it more distinct.</dd>

    <dt>Outline Outer Border</dt>

    <dd>A line will be drawn on the outside of the border.</dd>

    <dt>Show Active Border</dt>

    <dd>Not all controls display this, and there are some
    differences among controls about when one is active, but
    basically if the focus or mouse cursor is in the control, then
    a special border (drawn with the active border color) is drawn
    on the inside of the main border. This will be instead of the
    "Outline Inner Border" if both be specified.</dd>

    <dt>Despressed Background</dt>

    <dd>If selected (and the control supports it -- buttons do)
    then when the mouse is depressed in the control the background
    of the control changes color.</dd>

    <dt>Outline Default Button</dt>

    <dd>If the current control is a default button, then a special
    border is drawn well outside the normal border to indicate that
    it is.</dd>

    <dt>Background Gradient</dt>

    <dd>If set then the background is drawn as a reflected gradient
    with the normal background color drawn in the center
    (vertically) of the control and the background gradient color
    drawn at the top and bottom edges (like the [OK] button
    above).</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Then come a series of colors. Different colors may be
  specified for enabled and disabled controls. The border has four
  different colors, for the brightest, mid bright, mid dark and
  darkest edges of the control. Where each of the border colors is
  used depends on the border type.</p>

  <p>The peculiar button, <img src="colorbutton.png" width="97"
  height="29" align="middle" />, is a color button. It displays the
  current color in a rectangle, and, if pressed, invokes a color
  picker dialog.</p>

  <p><img src="colorpicker.jpeg" width="429" height="318" align=
  "right" /></p>

  <p>The color picker displays a Hue/Saturation/Value color wheel.
  A vertical bar on the right shows the Value, the wheel shows Hue
  and Saturation. The original color is displayed on the bottom
  left. The current color on the bottom right. If the color is not
  fully opaque a checker board of black and white squares will be
  visible under the colors.</p>

  <p>Not all colors support opacities (only those drawn on the
  cairo canvas), and for many colors the Opacity control will be
  hidden (and fixed at 1.0).</p>

  <p>Underneath the colors are ways of specifying the shape and
  type of the border, how wide it is, whether there is any padding
  between the border and the inner part of the control, and (for
  borders with a round-rectangle shape) the radius of the circle
  used to round the corners (a radius of 0 means: half the height
  of the control -- actually half the smaller dimension of the
  control).</p>

  <p>Finally we come to the font used in the control. This is
  specified by a number (between 0 and 1000) specifying the weight
  of the font (400 is normal, 700 is bold), a point size, and a
  comma separated list of font family names. Changing the font will
  not have any obvious effect until you restart the dialog.</p>

  <p>That specifies the standard box used to draw each control.
  Some controls have additional resources. The Button control above
  contains an additional boolean resource which (if set) will cause
  the text of the button to shift slightly right when the button is
  pressed. (This is another of those resources where you must
  restart the dialog to see it take effect).</p>

  <p>If you press the [OK] button then your current resource
  settings will be used in subsequent dialogs created by FontForge
  -- but any changes you make will vanish when you exit. If you
  press the [Save] button then your changes will be saved to disk,
  and (optionally) used the next time you start fontforge.</p>
