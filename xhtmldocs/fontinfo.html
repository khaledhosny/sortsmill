    <h2><a name="Names" id="Names">Names</a></h2>

    <p>PostScript fonts have several different names, but basically
    there are two important ones: the family name (like Times) and
    the fontname (which is the family name with a bunch of
    modifiers like Bold Italic Condensed tacked on to the end. The
    FullName is designed to be read by humans, while the others are
    for machines, this name can contain spaces (like "New Century
    Schoolbook-Bold Condensed"). Finally there is the weight name.
    All of these names should be in ASCII. If you wish to enter
    names with characters outside this range look at the <a href=
    "#TTF-Names">TTF Names</a> Section.</p>

    <p>The copyright field can contain whatever you want to put
    there, but it's a good place to put a copyright.</p>

    <p>In most fonts the version field is a string (and so has
    minimal constraints on it), but in CID keyed fonts it must be a
    floating point number.</p>

    <p>You may also specify a separate version number to be used in
    any sfnt generated from this database; this should be a
    floating point number. Or you may leave this field blank. If
    you leave it blank FontForge will generate a default value
    based on other version information specified elsewhere.</p>

    <p>Normally when <a href="generate.html">generating a font,</a>
    FontForge will use the fontname as the base for the default
    filename of the font file (the base to which the extension is
    added). But that is not always what you want. You may wish to
    attach a version string to the fontname, or abbreviate it, etc.
    The <code>Base Filename</code> field allows you to specify this
    to fontforge.</p>

    <p>Many of these names are similar to the english names of the
    <a href="fontinfo.html#TTF-Names">TTF Names</a> section. If
    nothing is specified in that section then the names specified
    here will be used by default in ttf files.</p>

    <h2><img src="fontinfo-general.png" width="614" height="546"
    align="right" /><a name="PS-General" id=
    "PS-General">General</a></h2>

    <p>This sub dialog contains a rather random collection of
    settings.</p>

    <p>The Ascent and Descent are (in this current definition)
    Macintosh concepts rather than PostScript, their sum, however,
    provides the size of the em-square and that is very much a
    postscript concept. For postscript fonts this number is set by
    strong convention to be 1000, while in most TrueType fonts it
    will be 2048 (also a convention, but TrueType claims
    rasterization is faster if the sum is a power of 2). Since both
    TrueType and Type1 (postscript) fonts represent numbers as
    16-bit integers ascent and descent must be less than 32767.
    TrueType is more restrictive and requires their sum to be less
    than 16384.</p>

    <p>If you change the size of the Em you may choose to have all
    the outlines (and kerning info) scaled to have the same
    proportion to the new value that they had to the old. Warning:
    <span class="c3"><strong>If your font has truetype instructions
    scaling may break the font as entries in the <code>'cvt
    '</code> table will not be scaled.</strong></span></p>

    <p>The Italic Angle indicates the slant of the font. FontForge
    can attempt to guess a good value for you by looking at the
    stems of certain letters ("I" for instance).</p>

    <p>The underline position and height provide a program using
    this font a hint as to where it should place a line if it wants
    to underline text printed in this font.</p>

    <p>If you want your font to have <a name="vertical" id=
    "vertical">vertical</a> metrics (generally this means you are
    working on a CJK font) then check the <code>[*] Has Vertical
    Metrics</code> checkbox. This will enable the Vertical Origin
    field, and will mean that when you generate a truetype or
    opentype font a vertical metrics table will be added. The
    Vertical Origin is the vertical offset from the origin of the
    design coordinate system to the origin for the purposes of
    vertical metrics.</p>

    <p><a name="Interpretation" id="Interpretation">Sadly</a> the
    encoding is not always sufficient for understanding the font's
    behavior. For example a unicode font designed for a chinese
    system will look very different from a unicode font for a
    japanese system (The same unicode character may map to very
    different chinese or japanese glyphs). To handle this FontForge
    has the concept of "Interpretation".</p>

    <p>When you create a new glyph in a font, fontforge will assign
    it a name based on the current <a href=
    "encodingmenu.html#namelist">namelist</a>.<br clear=
    "all" /></p>

    <h2><img src="fontinfo-layers.png" width="607" height="547"
    align="right" /><a name="Layers" id="Layers">Layers</a></h2>

    <p>You may control how many and what types of layers are
    available in your font.</p>

    <p>Fonts may be either outlined or stroked, or type3. You may
    choose which kind of font you want.</p>

    <p>You may also decide what kind of splines you want in the
    font in general, often all the layers will use the same type of
    splines (so there are radio buttons to make that easy), but it
    isn't required each layer may be in its own format.</p>

    <p>If you mark a layer as quadratic (or check <code>[*] All
    layers Quadratic)</code> then FontForge will use quadratic
    <a href="overview.html#spline">Bézier</a> splines for this
    layer rather than cubic Béziers, this means that FontForge will
    be using the native spline format of truetype rather than
    postscript (or opentype). When FontForge generates a font it
    will convert from whatever format is used internally to
    whatever format is required for the font, so there will be no
    problem if this is set incorrectly, but setting it correctly
    for your font means you get a clearer idea of what the outlines
    will look like. I find quadratic splines harder to edit with
    because each spline is less flexible, but the advantage of
    actually seeing what your truetype font will look like may
    outweigh that.</p>

    <p>You may also mark a layer as a foreground layer or a
    background layer. Background layers can hold images. Pasting
    into an empty glyph in a background layer will not set the
    width. Splines in background layers do not make a glyph worth
    outputting.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><img src="fontinfo-psuid.png" width="376" height="608"
    align="right" /><a name="PSUID" id="PSUID">PostScript Unique
    ID</a></h2>

    <p><span class=
    "c3"><small><strong>NOTE:</strong></small></span> <a href=
    "UniqueID.html">Adobe now says</a> that both XUID and UniqueID
    are unnecessary.</p>

    <p>The XUID field is a collection of numbers separated by
    spaces and enclosed in brackets. This allows you to specify the
    extended unique ID of the font. If you have set the XUID
    preference entry then FontForge will assign values to all new
    fonts (by appending a number unique to this font to the end of
    your preference item). Adobe recommends that the XUID be
    changed every time the font is changed, so each time you
    generate a postscript font, that font's XUID (if present) will
    be incremented by 1 (This incrementing does not happen in
    CID-keyed fonts, where the XUID behavior is too complex for
    this simple trick). (The XUID field is only meaningful in
    PostScript fonts).</p>

    <p>The UniqueID field is an older convention for the same
    purpose as XUID. If you do not fill in this field then
    FontForge will pick a random number for you in the allowable
    range. If you want your font to have no unique id then give
    this the value of -1. If you have talked to Adobe and been
    assigned a real UniqueID then you may use this field, otherwise
    leave it blank. (The UniqueID field is only meaningful in
    PostScript fonts)<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><a name="Private" id="Private">Private</a> --
    <small>(font-wide postscript hinting)</small></h2>

    <p><img src="fontinfo-private.png" width="480" height="548"
    align="right" />This sub-dialog shows most entries in the
    font's Private dictionary. The interesting things in this
    dictionary are mostly concerned with hints appropriate for the
    entire font. I shall not go into detail about the meanings of
    the various entries, that is best understood by reading
    <a href="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/PDFS/TN/T1_SPEC.PDF">
    Adobe's Type1 specification</a>.</p>

    <p>Don't try to change these until you understand what they
    mean.</p>

    <p>The dialog is shown at right. It consists of a list of
    dictionary key/value pairs. The keys are on the left, values on
    the right. Generally you will want to use the standard
    PostScript keys (these are available from a pulldown list that
    appears when you press one of the little grey buttons).</p>

    <p>Note: The values must be things which PostScript can parse.
    This means that <code>ForceBold</code> must have a value of
    "false" or "true", and "False" or "faux" will not work.
    Similarly the decimal point in numbers must be "." (not ",").
    If you enter a "," by mistake FontForge will convert it for
    you.</p>

    <p>For example the <code>BlueValues</code> entry specifies
    certain key regions of the font in a vertical direction. For
    instance it might contain the baseline serif, the x-height
    serif, the cap-height serif. It is expressed as an array of
    numbers, grouped in pairs. The first number of a pair is the
    low end of the region and the second is the high end. So in the
    example at right, the value of <code>BlueValues</code> is
    <code>[-20 0 437 457 583 603 623 643</code>.</p>

    <p>When the <code>[Guess]</code> button is enabled FontForge
    thinks it can make a reasonable guess for the value of the
    currently selected entry.</p>

    <p>The <code>[Histogram]</code> button is similar, it will
    bring up a <a href="histogram.html">dialog showing a
    histogram</a> of the values of an attribute of the font. The
    hope is that this will allow you to pick a good value for the
    entry.</p>

    <p>You may also delete an entry from the dictionary with the
    <code>[Delete]</code> button. Some entries (such as
    <code>BlueValues</code>) must be present in any type1 font, but
    you may still delete them. FontForge will simply guess at a
    reasonable value when it needs to generate the font.</p>

    <p>Certain keys affect things other than hints. The
    <code>lenIV</code> entry controls how much random padding is
    placed around the type1 strings when the font is generated.
    Normally this will be 4, but if you want to save space (4 bytes
    per glyph in pfb format, 8 bytes in pfa) you may choose another
    value. The UniqueID key represents the font's Unique postscript
    ID. If you provide a value here then FontForge will copy it
    into the UniqueID field in the Font Dictionary. (this is
    different from True Type's UniqueID. They perform the same
    function but are formatted differently).</p>

    <p>Some of these entries are only meaningful for PostScript
    fonts, others will be used by the truetype
    autoinstructor.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><img src="fontinfo-ttfvals.png" width="376" height="608"
    align="right" /><a name="TTF-Values" id=
    "TTF-Values">OS/2</a></h2>

    <p>This sub dialog contains settings important for Windows
    platforms, most of these settings live in the 'OS/2' table of a
    truetype or opentype font. The pane also includes a few pieces
    of data that do not live in the 'OS/2' table but are logically
    related.</p>

    <p>The weight class provides a numeric value describing the
    boldness of the font. A normal face will usually have a
    boldness of 400, and a bold face will usually be 700. This must
    be a number between 100 and 900.</p>

    <p>The width class allows you to provide a numeric value saying
    how condensed or expanded this font is.</p>

    <p>The PFM Family is used when generating PFM files and
    classifies the font into some rather broad categories (Serif,
    Sans, Monospace, Script, Decorative).</p>

    <p>You can control whether you want to allow your font to be
    embedded into other documents (most commonly pdf). You can
    restrict it so that it can never be embedded, it can be
    embedded into documents that can be printed (but not edited),
    it can be embedded into documents that can be edited, or it can
    be embedded into an editable document and later extracted and
    installed on a different system. You can also control whether
    the document producer is allowed to extract the glyphs it needs
    and make a new font from them (which saves space) or whether
    they must include the entire font if they use any of it.
    Finally you can restrict the embedding so that only bitmap
    versions of the font may be embedded. (meaningful in CID keyed
    postscript fonts as well as TTF and OTF).</p>

    <p>The "Vendor ID" is a four character ASCII field used to
    identify the creator of the font.</p>

    <p>The IBM Family is another classification scheme for
    fonts.</p>

    <p>Finally you may order lookups in the GSUB (or morx)
    table.</p>

    <p>These entries are only meaningful in TrueType and OpenType
    fonts (though the Embeddable entry (generally called FSType)
    will be set on CID keyed fonts even if they are not in an
    OpenType wrapper.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h3><code><a name="Order" id="Order"><img src="GSUB-Order.png"
    width="185" height="294" align="right" />GSUB/morx</a></code>
    Ordering</h3>

    <p>This dialog allows you to control the order features in
    which are to be executed by the word processing program. If you
    have loaded an opentype or truetype font then the original
    order will be maintained. As you add more features they will
    appear at the bottom of the list (which may not be
    appropriate). You may select a feature name and use the buttons
    to move it up and down in the list. Things at the top of the
    list are executed first, things at the bottom last.</p>

    <p><span class="c3"><strong>Caveat:</strong></span> Although
    the OpenType spec claims that the execution of features
    (actually lookups) will be ordered by their appearence in the
    lookup table, MicroSoft claims that they will apply features in
    the order that they think best. So the order specified in the
    font may be ignored.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><img src="fontinfo-ttfmetrics.png" width="376" height="608"
    align="right" /><a name="TTF-Metrics" id="TTF-Metrics">OS/2
    Metrics</a></h2>

    <p>The Windows Ascent and Descent fields are badly defined in
    the OpenType spec, which says that they should express the
    maximum range of the Windows "ANSI" glyphs. If one uses this
    definition, non-"ANSI" glyphs are cropped. These should be the
    maximum range of all glyphs to avoid cropping. But even that
    will not always work. If you have a line with marks which are
    repositioned with GPOS, then the marks may be cropped, so
    Windows Ascent should include the maximum possible height of
    repositioned marks (or any other GPOS vertical repositioning
    feature).</p>

    <p>This is too complex (and too ill defined) for FontForge to
    figure out, instead FontForge gives you a couple of
    options.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>You may set WinAscent and WinDescent directly. Turn off
      the "[ ] Is Offset" checkboxes and any value you provide will
      be used as is.</li>

      <li>Or you may specify an offset to be added to the maximum
      ascent and descent of the font (which FontForge will compute
      for you when it saves the font). If you don't have a mark to
      base feature, then I recommend that you set the offsets to 0,
      and check the "[*] Is Offset" checkboxes.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Both WinAscent and WinDescent should be positive
    numbers.</p>

    <p>The Typographic Ascent and Typographic Descent are
    <em>supposed</em> to represent the line spacing of the font on
    the windows platform. Sadly very few applications actually use
    them (most applications use the Windows Ascent/Descent
    described above).</p>

    <p>In traditional (Latin) typography, the unleaded line spacing
    should be 1em, and that is what Adobe recommends for these
    fields (they should sum to the Em-Size specified in the
    <a href="fontinfo.html#PS-General">General</a> pane). The
    Typographic Ascent should be the same as the font's Ascent, and
    the Typographic Descent should be the (negative) of the font's
    descent.</p>

    <p>The "[*] Is Offset" checkboxes behave much as they do above,
    except they specify offsets from the font's ascent and descent
    rather than its bounding box.</p>

    <p>The Typographic descent should be a negative number, the
    ascent a positive number.</p>

    <p>You can also specify the default line gap, or leading
    between lines.</p>

    <p>The mac uses a different set of fields for the same
    concepts, and stores them in the 'hhea' table rather than the
    'OS/2'. The HHead Ascent and Descent are used to specify
    clipping (in some applications) and line spacing. They behave
    very much the way the Win Ascent &amp; Descent behave (they are
    based on bounding box values). And the 'hhea' table has its own
    line gap field.</p>

    <p>And if your font has vertical metrics enabled (See <a href=
    "fontinfo.html#PS-General">General</a> above) you will be able
    to set the default spacing between vertical columns of text.
    (the equivalent to LineGap in vertical text).</p>

    <p><a href="faq.html#linespace">See the FAQ</a> for a
    discussion on the complexities involved in setting the line

    <p>The OS/2 table also contain information on scaling and
    positioning subscripts and superscripts.</p>

    <p>Most fonts don't really need this control. If you leave the
    [*] Default check box on, then FontForge will generate some
    reasonable values on output (if nothing significant changes, it
    will use the values shown here). If you want control of these

    <p>This sub-dialog allows you to describe your font in 10
    different dimensions. The exact meanings of many of these
    entries vary from script to script, and even the Latin ones are
    not clear to me, I have merely typed them in as specified in
    the <a href=
    "http://fonts.apple.com/TTRefMan/RM06/Chap6OS2.html">true type
    docs</a>. Better information is available from <a href=

    MS</a>, <a href=
    "http://forum.high-logic.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=941">discussion</a>.</p>

    <p>If you leave the [*] Default checkbox set then FontForge
    will generate reasonable values when the font is output,
    otherwise you may set these values manually.</p>

    <p>These entries are only meaningful for TrueType, OpenType and

    <h2><img src="fontinfo-charsets.png" align="right" width="614"
    height="546" /><a name="Charsets" id=

    <p>The OS/2 table contains two fields which give some
    information about the characters in the font. Windows is very
    picky about using fonts if the proper code page bits are not
    set. If you leave the [*] Default checkboxes set then FontForge
    will generate reasonable values when the font is output.
    Sometimes you need to override that behavior if you wish
    Windows to use a font with an incomplete code page.</p>

    <p>These entries are only meaningful for TrueType, and OpenType
    fonts.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><img src="fontinfo-ttfname.png" width="602" height="534"
    align="right" /><a name="TTF-Names" id="TTF-Names">TTF
    Names</a></h2>

    <p>TrueType (and OpenType) fonts are allowed to have different
    names in different languages. So a French user might see
    CaslonItalic displayed as CaslonItalique in a font menu, while
    a German user might see CaslonKursive. There are about 20
    different strings which may be customized into various
    different languages. Customizing one string does not mean that
    you must customize the others (indeed, often only the Style
    string will be customized).</p>

    <p>The image at right shows the dialog, displaying all the
    strings set for the given font. You may order these strings
    based on type of string (ordered as below), on language
    (ordered by unicode), or by a variation of language which
    displays strings for the language of the current locale first,
    then English strings (because, in general, these will be the
    most important for the user) and then ordered by language
    thereafter.</p>

    <p>Certain strings in English (Copyright, Family, Styles,
    Fullname, Version) will always be present. If you do not set
    them explicitly they will be taken (possibly with
    modifications) from the equivalent postscript strings on the
    <a href="fontinfo.html#Names">Names</a> pane. You may not
    remove these strings, and if you wish to modify them you must
    first detach them from the PostScript. In the example at right
    the strings bound to PostScript are shown in red (Copyright,
    Family, Styles), while Fullname and Version have been detached
    and modified.</p>

    <p>You may change the language of a string by clicking the
    mouse on the language field of that string -- a popup menu will
    appear giving you a choice of all supported locale/languages.
    (You may not modify the language of the special English strings
    mentioned above).</p>

    <p>You may change the string type in a similar manner, again
    you may not change the special English strings.</p>

    <p>If you click with the right button on a string you will
    bring up a different popup menu which will allow you to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Detach a string from its PostScript equivalent if any (so
      you can modify it)</li>

      <li>Delete a string entirely (except for the special strings
      bound to PostScript)</li>

      <li>Edit a string in a larger window.<br clear="all" /></li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you click with the left button on a string value you may
    edit that string in line, if it is small enough, <img src=
    "fontinfo-ttfname-bigedit.png" width="343" height="341" align=
    "right" />otherwise in a larger window.</p>

    <p>If you wish to add a new string, click on the &lt;New&gt;
    entry at the bottom. You will be given the standard language
    popup and it will create a new string for you.</p>

    <p>The various strings and a brief description of their
    meanings are:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Copyright</dt>

      <dd>Allows you to specify the copyright message</dd>

      <dt>Family</dt>

      <dd>The font's family name</dd>

      <dt>Styles (SubFamily)</dt>

      <dd>This should (in English) have values like
      "BoldItalicCondensed". This is the most likely string to
      change in different languages.</dd>

      <dt>Fullname</dt>

      <dd>The concatenation of the Family name and the Styles
      name</dd>

      <dt>UniqueID</dt>

      <dd>This is a string that uniquely identifies the font in a
      human readable fashion. Its format is quite different from
      postscript's UniqueID and FontForge will create an
      appropriate string if you don't specify one (rather than
      copying from postscript).</dd>

      <dt>Version</dt>

      <dd>A string containing the version number of the font.</dd>

      <dt>PostScript Name</dt>

      <dd>(FontForge will not let you set this directly. It will be
      set automatically to the postscript fontname, only one
      instance of this tag is allowed in the font and it must be
      ASCII)</dd>

      <dt>Trademark</dt>

      <dd>A string containing any trademark information for the
      font.</dd>

      <dt>Manufacturer</dt>

      <dd>The name of the company that distributes the font.</dd>

      <dt>Designer</dt>

      <dd>The name of the person who designed the font.</dd>

      <dt>Descriptor</dt>

      <dd>A description of the font and its characteristics.</dd>

      <dt>VendorURL</dt>

      <dd>An URL pointing to the font's vendor.</dd>

      <dt>DesignerURL</dt>

      <dd>An URL (often an e-mail address) pointing to the font's
      designer</dd>

      <dt>License</dt>

      <dd>A string describing the license terms under which the
      font is marketed.<br />
      If you want to use the <a href=
      "http://scripts.sil.org/OFL/">SIL Open Font License</a>,

      MicroSoft recently (2009) released a security patch in which they decided

      many licenses <EM>are</EM> bigger than 5K, the OFL is for one, so it is now

      of the license == at least it is if you want your font to work on Windows.

      <dt>License URL</dt>

      <dd>An URL pointing to a page describing the terms of the
      license</dd>

      <dt>Preferred Family</dt>

      <dd>This is to get around a quirk of windows where only four
      Style names are allowed per family, so font families with
      more than four styles would get different family names above,
      but the preferred family name would be the same. This should
      only be specified if it differs from the family</dd>

      <dt>Preferred Style</dt>

      <dd>This is similar to the above, except it applies to the
      style.</dd>

      <dt>Compatible Full</dt>

      <dd>This is to get around a quirk on the Mac.</dd>

      <dt>Sample Text</dt>

      <dd>Whatever.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>These are described in the <a href=
    "http://fonts.apple.com/TTRefMan/RM06/Chap6name.html">original
    true type docs</a>, but they apply to <a href=
    "http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/opentype/recom.jsp">open
    type</a> as well.</p>

    <p>These settings specify strings for the windows platform with
    unicode encoding.</p>

    <p>Generally fonts will have a fairly complete set of strings
    in the American English entry, with the Style string (and
    nothing else) translated into different languages.</p>

    <p>When you create a Style entry for an language, FontForge
    will attempt to translate the American English style into
    something appropriate for that language. It understands
    languages in <a href="fontstyles.html">the table on the font
    styles page</a>, but not others so it won't always work.</p>

    <p>So if your style in American English is "BoldItalic" then
    after you create the appropriate strings FontForge will default
    to "GrasItalique" for French, "FettKursiv" for German,
    "NigritaCursiva" for Spanish, etc.</p>

    <p>These names are only meaningful for TrueType and OpenType
    fonts.</p>

    <h2><a name="SSNames" id="SSNames"><img src=
    "fontinfo-ssnames.png" width="614" height="374" align=
    "right" />StyleSet Names</a></h2>

    <p>The OpenType features 'ss01'-'ss20' are magic, and you are
    allowed to provide more interesting names for them than the
    default "Style Set 01"... This table allows you to assign
    names, in various languages to the various features. It is very
    similar to, though less complicated than, the previous
    pane.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><img src="fontinfo-gasp.png" width="540" height="314"
    align="right" /><a name="gasp" id="gasp">Grid Fit ('gasp'
    table)</a></h2>

    <p>The TrueType 'gasp' table gives you control over whether the
    rasterizer should do grid-fitting or anti-aliasing at any given
    pixel size. Note that this table only applies to
    <em>TrueType</em> fonts, it does not apply to Type2 PostScript
    (fonts with .otf extension).</p>

    <p>The table consists of a set of pixel sizes with
    corresponding flags. For each entry in the table the flags
    apply to all pixel sizes bigger than the previous entry but
    less than or equal to the current entry. The table must be
    terminated with a pixel size of 65535.</p>

    <p>Pressing the [Default] button will provide you with a
    default 'gasp' table. If your font contains no instructions
    this will be different than the 'gasp' table for a font with
    instructions.</p>

    <p>MS has recently expanded the table. Version 0 of the table
    had two bits for each pixel value, version 1 has four bits, two
    of which control the behavior of their ClearType rasterizer.
    They have also added a bit to the 'head' table called
    optimized_for_cleartype; if this bit is not set then some fonts
    will not be hinted.</p>

    <p>In the table above:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>All pixel sizes less than or equal to 8 will not be
      grid-fit but will have anti-alias applied</li>

      <li>All pixel sizes between 9 and 16 (inclusive) will be
      grid-fit but not anti-aliased.</li>

      <li>All pixel sizes above 16 will be both grid-fit and
      anti-aliased, and will have Cleartype Symetric Smoothing
      done.<br clear="all" /></li>
    </ul>

    <h2><img src="fontinfo-tex.png" width="376" height="600" align=
    "right" /><a name="TeX" id="TeX">TeX</a></h2>

    <p>This allows you to set the TeX font parameters (which are
    described in Appendix F, pp 98-100 of the MetaFont Book). There
    seem to be 3 different types of font parameters, those for text
    fonts, those for math fonts and those for math extension fonts.
    The later two have additional parameters which are accessible
    through the [More Params] button. The default values for the
    Math parameters are probably reasonable. <span class=
    "c3"><strong>The default values for the Math Extension
    parameters are probably unreasonable</strong></span>.</p>

    <p>These values are stored in tfm files (should you generate a
    tfm file with your font).<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><img src="fontinfo-size.png" align="right" width="453"
    height="548" /><a name="Size" id="Size">Size</a></h2>

    <p>This allows you to set the design size of a font, the design
    range, and provide a style name for this class of font.</p>

    <p>In tradtional typography every point size of a given font
    would be slightly different -- generally small point sizes
    would have proportionally more white-space around the glyph and
    wider stems inside the glyph. This made small point sizes more
    readable than they would otherwise be. Conversely large
    pointsizes would tend to have less white space around them,
    otherwise the letters would appear too far apart.</p>

    <p><a href="multiplemaster.html">Multi-master fonts</a> provide
    one method to avoid this problem. This dialog provides another.
    Suppose you have a series of font-faces designed for different
    point-sizes.</p>

    <table cellpadding="2">
      <tr>
        <td>Ambrosia-Regular-Small</td>

        <td>&lt;9pt</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Ambrosia-Regular-Text</td>

        <td>9-13pt</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Ambrosia-Regular-Heading</td>

        <td>14-23pt</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Ambrosia-Regular-Display</td>

        <td>&gt;=24pt</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Then you would fill in this dialog to allow the font system
    to figure out which font was appropriate for which point size.
    The dialog displays the font's optimal size -- its design size,
    and the point range within which it can be used.</p>

    <p>In the example above all the different fonts would have the
    same "Style-ID" this is an arbetrary number that links all
    fonts with this ID together (all fonts in the same family, that
    is). However, Ambrosia-Italic-Text would have a different Style
    ID. All fonts with the same Style ID should have the same Style
    Name. Note that font names are now something like
    "Ambrosia-Regular-Heading" -- the user should not be subjected
    to that complication, as far as s/he is concerned there is just
    a font called "Ambrosia-Regular" and all four of the above
    fonts are just instances of it. So the Style Name of all four
    fonts above should be "Regular".</p>

    <p>Adobe allows two forms of size information. In one, only the
    design size field is specified, in the other all the fields
    must be specified. This means that if you want to supply a
    design range you are also required to provide a style id and
    name.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><img src="fontinfo-comment.png" width="369" height="506"

    <p>This allows you to keep track of arbitrary comments inside
    your font database. It does not correspond to any postscript or
    truetype entity. It is intended to store a changelog for the
    font itself, but could be used for other purposes...</p>

    <p>Various font formats allow a random comment to be placed in
    the font, but no format makes use of it. This is primarily to
    be used inside FontForge. The comment should be in ASCII.</p>

    <h2><a name="FontLog" id="FontLog">FONTLOG</a></h2>

    <p>This has the same interface as the Comment above. The
    FONTLOG is an idea stolen from the Open Font License. It is
    description of the font and a log of changes made to it over
    time and includes some more information about the font as well
    (see the <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/OFL-FAQ_web">OFL
    FAQ)</a>. This pane allows you to store this information within
    the font itself where it won't get lost.</p>

    (spring 2009) there is essentially no support for mark sets,
    but that will change (Both Adobe and MicroSoft say their next
    releases will support it).</p>

    <p>The idea behind both is similar: In many lookups it is
    important to be able to ignore some mark glyphs, but not
    others. For example when forming an arabic ligature, the vowel
    marks are (usually) irrelevant to the ligature and you would
    want to ignore all marks. In situations where you are
    positioning marks on a base glyph you might in one case, want
    to ignore all marks that position on top of the glyph while
    paying attention to those underneath it. And then in another
    lookup, the reverse might be true.</p>

    <p>At any rate, in some cases it is important to be able to
    categorize marks. Both classes and sets let you do this. In the
    example right, latin marks have been divided into those above
    the glyph and those below.</p>

    <p>A glyph may appear in at most one class, while it may appear
    in many sets. So when implemented, sets will be more versatile.
    On the other hand classes can be stored more compactly in the
    font file (a slight advantage).</p>

    <p>Once you have created your classes (or sets, or both) you
    may use them in the <a href="lookups.html#Add-Lookup">Add
    Lookup</a> dialog from the <a href=
    "fontinfo.html#Lookups">Lookup</a> pane.</p>

    <p>The Mark Set pane looks almost exactly like the Mark Class
    pane, and functions similarly. From these panes you may add new
    classes, or edit old ones.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><a name="Lookups" id="Lookups">Lookups</a></h2>

    <p><img src="fontinfo-lookups.png" width="602" height="534"
    align="right" alt="Font Info Anchors" /> This pane is so
    complex that it merits its <a href="lookups.html">own
    section</a>.</p>

    <p>Briefly, lookups contain the data to do the work needed for
    complex typography. There are two main classes of lookups,
    those which substitute glyphs (ligatures for example) and live
    in the GSUB table, and those which position glyphs (kerning for
    example) and live in the GPOS table.</p>

    <p>Each lookup is composed of one or many subtables.</p>

    <p>There are buttons to the side to create (add) new lookups
    and subtables, and to edit their attributes (metadata) and
    their commands (data).</p>

    <p>The order in which the lookups appear in this dialog is the
    order in which they will be applied. The order of the subtables
    within each lookup is the order in which they will be applied.
    There are buttons to the side which will reorder things.</p>

    <p>It is possible to merge two lookups (if they are of the same
    type) or to merge two subtables (if they are in the same lookup
    and are similar enough).</p>

    <p>It is possible to import lookups from other fonts (which
    must already be loaded into fontforge.</p>

    <p>It is possible to drag and drop lookups to reorder them, or
    to copy them from one font to another (by dragging them into
    the other font's <code>Font Info-&gt;Lookups</code> pane).</p>

    <p>There is a popup menu, available by right clicking on an
    entry, which provides these functions as well as:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Save Lookup</dt>

      <dd>Saves the currently selected lookup to an <a href=
      "featurefile.html">Adobe Feature File</a> of its very
      own.</dd>

      <dt>Add 'aalt' features</dt>

      <dd>FontForge can automagically generate an 'aalt' feature
      consisting of every single and alternate substitution of each
      glyph.</dd>

      <dt>Add 'DFLT' script</dt>

      <dd>Add the DFLT script to all selected lookups</dd>

      <dt>Add language to script</dt>

      <dd>Add the specified language to the specified script in all
      selected lookups.</dd>

      <dt>Remove Language from script</dt>

      <dd>Removes the specified language from the specified script
      in all selected lookups.</dd>

      <dt>Save Feature File</dt>

      <dd>Saves all lookups (both GSUB and GPOS) to an <a href=
      "featurefile.html">Adobe Feature File</a>.<br clear="all" />
      <br clear="all" /></dd>
    </dl>

    <h2><img src="fontinfo-woff.png" width="614" height="548"
    align="right" alt="Font Info WOFF" /> <a name="WOFF" id=
    "WOFF">WOFF</a> (Web Open Font Format)</h2>

    <p>This sub-dialog allows you to specify additional information
    which may be stored in a woff file. A woff file is very similar
    to a standard sfnt except that its tables are compressed, and
    it has a few additional data fields. It has version number
    fields for the WOFF file, a major and a minor version. If you
    leave these fields blank then fontforge will generate defaults
    based on some of the other font version information available
    to it.</p>

    <p>It also has a metadata string. This is a small xml document
    (which ff does not currently parse), stored in utf8. Its
    internal format is specified in <a href=
    "http://people.mozilla.com/~jkew/woff/woff-2009-09-16.html">a
    document from Mozilla</a>.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><img src="fontinfo-macstyle.png" width="376" height="608"
    align="right" alt="Font Info Mac Styles" /> <a name="Mac-Style"
    id="Mac-Style">Mac Style</a> &amp; FOND</h2>

    <p>This sub-dialog allows you to set the mac style of your
    font. Normally FontForge will be able to guess the style from
    the fontname (and various other clues), but sometimes the name
    will be non-standard (or perhaps just in a language FontForge
    doesn't know about), and other times you may wish to override
    this default setting.</p>

    <p>If you are happy with the default, just leave the Automatic
    button checked, if you wish to override check the button next
    to the list box. You may select any combination of styles
    (remember to hold down the control key to get multiple
    selections) except for one containing both "Condense" and
    "Expand".</p>

    <p>Note: If you want the style to be "Regular" then leave all
    styles unselected.</p>

    <p>The mac style is stored in the header of an sfnt (truetype
    or opentype font file), but is most important in creating mac
    font families.</p>

    <p>The <a name="FONDName" id="FONDName">FOND</a> name is only
    used for generating mac families. It is a grouping level
    underneath the family level. See the <a href=
    "faq.html#How-family">FAQ</a> for a discussion on when to use
    this.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><img src="fontinfo-macfeat.png" width="376" height="600"
    align="right" alt="Font Info Mac Features" /> <a name=
    "Mac-Features" id="Mac-Features">Mac Features</a></h2>

    <p>This sub-dialog allows you to create and remove Mac features
    from your font. This will override the Mac features specified
    in the <a href="prefs.html#Mac">preferences dialog</a> for this
    particular font (for example to give a more appropriate but
    local name to a certain feature setting).<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><a name="Dates" id="Dates">Dates</a></h2>

    <p>Displays what fontforge thinks is the create date and
    modification date of the font data. FontForge started retaining
    those dates in August of 2006, any prior dates are conjectural
    and based on a best guess -- usually from the modification time
    of the sfd file. When loading a font from somthing other than
    an sfd file, FontForge will again make the best guess it
    can.</p>

    <h2><a name="Unicode" id="Unicode"><img src=
    "fontinfo-unicode.png" width="494" height="552" align=
    "right" />Unicode Ranges</a></h2>

    <p>Displays information about the various unicode character
    ranges included in the font.</p>

    <p>If you click on a range, the font view will select all
    characters in that range and scroll to one of them.</p>

    <p>If you double click on a range, the font view will select
    any characters not defined in the font within that range, and
    scroll to one of them.<br clear="all" /></p>
