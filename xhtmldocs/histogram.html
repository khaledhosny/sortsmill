    <h1 class="c1"><img src="histogram.png" width="372" height=
    "482" align="right" />The histogram dialog</h1>

    <p>The histogram dialog is used to display three things which
    are useful for setting the some of the global hinting values
    that live in the PostScript <a href=
    "fontinfo.html#Private">Private dictionary</a>. The dialog can
    display</p>

    <ul>
      <li>the distribution of horizontal stem widths<br />
      which is helpful in setting [StdHW] and [StemSnapH]</li>

      <li>the distribution of vertical stem widths<br />
      which is helpful in setting [StdVW] and [StemSnapV]</li>

      <li>and the distribution of the minimal and maximal vertical
      positions of each glyph<br />
      which is helpful in setting [BlueValues] and
      [OtherBlues]</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Moving the mouse around the histogram at the top of the
    dialog will cause little popups to appear showing how many
    stems there are with a given width, how that compares to the
    maximum count, and what glyphs have that width.</p>

    <p>For both HStem and VStem, if you click on a histogram bar
    then that width will become the new value for Std[H/V]W, and
    will be the sole value for StemSnap[H/V]. Shift-clicking on a
    bar will add that width to StemSnap[H/V].</p>

    <p>For BlueValues, entries must be made in pairs, and FontForge
    can't tell until the second value is selected where the pair
    should be placed. So for BlueValues you must click on two
    histogram bars (click on the leftmost one first). Then if the
    second value is negative both will be added to OtherBlues,
    otherwise both will be added to BlueValues.</p>

    <p>The BarWidth textfield allows you to change the width of the
    histogram bars. The default value is 6 pixels wide.</p>

    <p>The SumAround textfield is an attempt to give you a feel for
    the distribution if it has been smeared out. If SumAround is 0
    then the count displayed for a given width is the number of
    stems with that width, if SumAround is 1 the count also
    includes the number of stems that are one unit wider or less
    wide than the given value, and higher values of SumAround give
    wider smearing. Just because a given width is at a local maxima
    does not mean that it is the appropriate value to be entered in
    the StemSnap array, you may find that if you smear things out a
    bit that a near-by value would be a slightly better choice.</p>

    <p>Pressing [OK] will set the indicated values in the font's
    private dictionary.</p>

    <p>When invoked from the <a href="fontinfo.html#Private">font
    info dialog</a> these dialogs will display information on all
    glyphs. When invoked from the Hint-&gt;Histograms menu of the
    font view then only information on selected glyphs will be
    shown (if no glyphs are selected, then again information will
    come from all glyphs). Characters containing references will
    not be counted.</p>

    <p>FontForge can automatically generate these values for you
    (this dialog gives you the information you need to make your
    own choices which may be better than what FontForge will do on
    its own -- it uses essentially these data itself). This will
    happen when you generate a postscript font and the font has no
    BlueValues or StemSnap information associated with it, or when
    you use the <a href="fontinfo.html#Private">Element-&gt;Font
    Info-&gt;Private</a> dialog.</p>
