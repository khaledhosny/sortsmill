  <div id="in">
    <h1 class="c1"><a name="TeX" id="TeX">FontForge and
    TeX</a></h1>

    <p>FontForge has a number of features built in to it to deal
    with TeX.</p>

    <p>It can read "pk" and "gf" bitmap files and <a href=
    "elementmenu.html#AutoTrace">autotrace</a> them to generate
    outline fonts. It can even invoke metafont directly on a ".mf"
    file, generate a "gf" bitmap from that, autotrace it and
    generate an outline font.</p>

    <p>It can read ligature, kerning information from a ".tfm"
    file. It can create a tfm file.</p>

    <p>The <a href="Encodings.ps.gz">encodings</a> file has a
    number of standard TeX encodings built in to it.</p>

    <p>For large CJK truetype fonts it can read a sub-font
    definition file as defined in the ttf2tfm man page and <a href=
    "generate.html">generate</a> a series of postscript type-1
    fonts based on those two.</p>

    <p>In consultation with the lilypond group we have designed a
    new <a href="non-standard.html">SFNT table 'TeX</a> ' for
    storing TeX specific information in True/OpenType files.</p>

    <h3>Generating a tfm file (and an enc file).</h3>

    <p>Before you generate a tfm file you should perform some of
    the following</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Set the font parameters</dt>

      <dd>Do this with Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;TeX.</dd>

      <dt>Optionally set <a name="Italic" id="Italic">Italic</a>
      Correction values for glyphs</dt>

      <dd>
        (FontForge will generate default values for italic fonts,
        so you only need do this if FontForge gets it wrong).

        <ul>
          <li>Select a glyph which should have an Italic
          Correction</li>

          <li>Element-&gt;Glyph Info-&gt;Alt Pos</li>

          <li>Press [New]</li>

          <li>Set the tag to <code>Italic Correction</code> from
          the pulldown list</li>

          <li>Set the XAdvance to the italic correction</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt>Optionally set any <a name="charlist" id=
      "charlist">glyphlists</a></dt>

      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>Select the first glyph in the glyphlist (the smallest
          one)</li>

          <li>Element-&gt;Glyph Info-&gt;Alt Subs</li>

          <li>Press [New]</li>

          <li>Set the tag to <code>TeX Glyphlist</code> from the
          pulldown list</li>

          <li>Type the names of all the other glyphs in the
          glyphlist into the Components field<br />
          So if the charlist is for left parenthesis<br />
          You would select the lparen glyph and might type in
          "lparen.big lparen.bigger lparen.biggest"</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt>Optionally set any <a name="extension" id=
      "extension">extension</a> glyphs.</dt>

      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>If the glyph is in a charlist then Select the last
          glyph in the glyphlist (the largest one)</li>

          <li>Element-&gt;Glyph Info-&gt;Mult Subs</li>

          <li>Press [New]</li>

          <li>Set the tag to <code>TeX Extension list</code> from
          the pulldown list</li>

          <li>Type the names of the glyphs that this glyph
          decomposes into in the order: top middle bottom
          extension<br />
          If a field is not present use .notdef<br />
          So if the extension list is for left parenthesis<br />
          You would select the lparen.biggest glyph and might type
          in "lparen.top lparen.mid lparen.bottom lparen.ext"</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Note: When FontForge does a File-&gt;Merge Feature Info on a
    tfm file, it will set these values appropriately.</p>

    <p>Having done this to your satisfaction you are ready to
    generate a tfm file. Go to File-&gt;Generate Fonts, select one
    of the postscript encodings from the pulldown list, press the
    [Options] button and turn on the [*] Tfm &amp; Enc check
    box.</p>

    <p>I'm not sure what you <em>do</em> with these files yet, but
    this should create them.</p>

    <h3><a name="TeX-Install" id="TeX-Install">Installing a type1
    (pfb) postscript font for TeX</a></h3>

    <p>I am a novice TeX/LaTeX user so my comments should be taken
    with a grain of salt. I did manage to get this process to work
    on my own system.</p>

    <p>Installing a PostScript font for TeX is more complicated
    than one would hope (and so far I've only figured out how to
    install a Latin font). Instead of just moving the font file to
    some standard directory you must:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>&lt;configure TeX so that it is prepared for local
      additions&gt;</li>

      <li>Rename the font file so that the filename is in a format
      TeX understands<br />
      (I'm told this isn't required, but I couldn't get things to
      work without doing this. Perhaps I have an old system.
      Perhaps I didn't try hard enough)</li>

      <li>Create several helper files that TeX will use for its own
      purposes</li>

      <li>Move each file type into its own special directory</li>

      <li>Optionally: Create a package file to make it easy for
      LaTeX to find the font</li>

      <li>Optionally: Move the package file into its own
      directory</li>

      <li>Use the updmap script or manually:

        <ul>
          <li>Update dvips's configuration files so that it knows
          where to look for the postscript fonts</li>

          <li>Optionally: Update pdftex's configuration files so
          that it knows where to look too.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>I suggest that before you read further you look at the
    following resources on the web:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It is possible to add your fonts to the standard TeX
      directory structure, but the TeX guru's frown on this as it
      makes updating TeX difficult. They suggest instead that you
      make all your changes in some parallel directory and provide
      they instructions on how to go about doing this at: <a href=
      "http://www.ctan.org/installationadvice/">Installation advice
      for TeX fonts and directories</a>. They also provide an
      example of a font installation but that is better explained
      in <a href=
      "http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/Type1fonts/fontinstallationguide.pdf">
      the LaTeX font-faq</a>.</li>

      <li>Old versions of TeX (ie. mine) are still worried about
      the old 8 character limitation on DOS filenames. This means
      that the tools I was using don't accept understandable
      filenames instead they require a format described in
        <a href="http://www.tug.org/fontname/html/index.html">TeX
        font file naming conventions</a>. If you are creating your
        own fonts this boils down to:

        <ul>
          <li>the first letter of the font should be "f" (which
          means the font wasn't made by one of the big-name font
          vendors)</li>

          <li>the next two letters are some abbreviation of the
          family-name for your font</li>

          <li>the next letter (or two) should be "r" for a roman
          font, "i" for italic, "o" for oblique, "b" for bold, and
          "bi" for bold italic</li>

          <li>the last two letters should be "8a" (which means your
          font is in Adobe Standard Encoding. And your font
          <em>must be</em> in that encoding or things don't
          work).<br />
          (Again I am told that you can use any encoding as long as
          you register it with TeX. I was unable to get this to
          work. But my system is out of date)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Finally <a href=
      "http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/Type1fonts/fontinstallationguide.pdf">
        the LaTeX font-faq</a> describes the gory details of how to
        go about installing the font. Its only (minor) drawback is
        that it assumes you are installing a font from Adobe. That
        is easily glossed over it means that:

        <ul>
          <li>fonts from Adobe should have font names beginning
          with "p" rather than "f".</li>

          <li>the translation from adobe's font-families to 2
          character abbreviations has already been done, when using
          an adobe font you look the family up in a table to get
          the 2 character abbreviation, when creating your own font
          you make up your own.</li>

          <li>the vendor directory for adobe is "adobe", but the
          vendor directory for fonts you make should be
          "public"</li>

          <li>(I hope these comments will make sense after you've
          read the above links)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>I've not tried to work with truetype fonts, but here's a
      document that talks about it to some extent. <a href=
      "http://www.radamir.com/tex/ttf-tex.htm">LaTeX and
      TTF</a></li>

      <li>If you are interested in the basics, here's the
      documentation on <a href=
      "http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/utilities/fontinst/doc/fontinst.ps">
      fontinst</a> itself.</li>

      <li>I don't know how to deal with cyrillic (except that
      cyrillic T2 encodings are called 6a), greek or CJK fonts
      yet.</li>

      <li>Here's some info on how to use fonts once they are
      installed: <a href=
      "http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/fonts.html">
      LaTeX and fonts</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>I did the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>I created a directory structure as described in <a href=
      "http://www.ctan.org/installationadvice/">Installation
      advice</a> (and also in <a href=
      "http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/Type1fonts/fontinstallationguide.pdf">
      the LaTeX font-faq</a>).</li>

      <li>I made a font (which I will call Cupola), initially I
      encoded it with the TeX Base Encoding (this was to make sure
      I had all the characters I needed)</li>

      <li>Then just before generating it I reencoded it into Adobe
      Standard Encoding (because TeX's fontinst routine expects
      that)</li>

      <li>I generated the font naming it "fcur8a.pfb" which means:

        <ul>
          <li>f -- made by a small font vendor, public domain,
          etc.</li>

          <li>cu -- abbreviation for the family name "Cupola"</li>

          <li>r -- roman face</li>

          <li>8a -- Adobe Standard Encoding</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>I applied the following script:

        <blockquote>
          <pre>
#!/bin/bash
# You will need to change the next two lines to suit your font.
# You may need to change the two after that as well.
BASE=fcu
PACKAGE=cupola
VENDOR=public
LOCALTEXMF=/usr/local/share/texmf

# remove any old files that might be lying around and might confuse us later on
csh -c "rm fi.tex *.mtx *.pl *.vpl"

# create a little script to get TeX to create various useful files it needs
echo "\\input fontinst.sty" &gt;fi.tex
echo "\\latinfamily{$BASE}{}" &gt;&gt;fi.tex
echo "\\bye" &gt;&gt;fi.tex

#execute that script
tex fi

# But we need to do a bit more processing on some of those files
for file in *.pl ; do
pltotf $file
done
for file in *.vpl ; do
vptovf $file
done

# Get rid of stuff we don't need any more
rm fi.tex *.mtx *.pl *.vpl

# create the directories we need for the various components
mkdir -p $LOCALTEXMF/fonts/type1/$VENDOR/$PACKAGE \
        $LOCALTEXMF/fonts/afm/$VENDOR/$PACKAGE \
        $LOCALTEXMF/fonts/tfm/$VENDOR/$PACKAGE \
        $LOCALTEXMF/fonts/vf/$VENDOR/$PACKAGE \
        $LOCALTEXMF/tex/latex/$VENDOR/$PACKAGE

# move everything into its expected directory
cp $BASE*.pfb $LOCALTEXMF/fonts/type1/$VENDOR/$PACKAGE
cp $BASE*.afm $LOCALTEXMF/fonts/afm/$VENDOR/$PACKAGE
mv $BASE*.tfm $LOCALTEXMF/fonts/tfm/$VENDOR/$PACKAGE
mv $BASE*.vf $LOCALTEXMF/fonts/vf/$VENDOR/$PACKAGE
mv *$BASE*.fd $LOCALTEXMF/tex/latex/$VENDOR/$PACKAGE

# finally create the LaTeX package for this font (and put it in the right place)
echo "\\ProvidesPackage{$PACKAGE}" &gt; $LOCALTEXMF/tex/latex/$VENDOR/$PACKAGE/$PACKAGE.sty
echo "\\renewcommand{\\rmdefault}{$BASE}" &gt;&gt; $LOCALTEXMF/tex/latex/$VENDOR/$PACKAGE/$PACKAGE.sty
echo "\\endinput" &gt;&gt; $LOCALTEXMF/tex/latex/$VENDOR/$PACKAGE/$PACKAGE.sty

# but updating the map files required a bit more knowlege than this script has
# so I left that to be done by hand
echo "*********************************************************************"
echo You need to create your own map files
echo One should be called $LOCALTEXMF/dvips/config/$BASE.map and should
echo " contain a line for each file in the family. One might look like this:"
echo "${BASE}r8a $PACKAGE-Regular \"TexBase1Encoding ReEncodeFont\" &lt;8r.enc &lt;${BASE}r8a.pfb"
echo Then change the config.ps file by looking for the location defining the
echo " standard map file and adding:"
echo "p +$BASE.map"
echo " after it."
echo Then go to $LOCALTEXMF/pdftex/config/
echo Make a copy "(or a link)" of $LOCALTEXMF/dvips/config/$BASE.map
echo and edit pdftex.cfg and insert
echo "p +$BASE.map"
echo at the appropriate place in it too.
