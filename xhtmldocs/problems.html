    <h1 class="c1">Finding common font problems automagically</h1>

    <p>Nobody is perfect.</p>

    <p>Well, I'm not.</p>

    <p>When you draw your glyphs you are likely to make some minor
    errors, like having stems with slightly different widths in
    different glyphs, or having lines which aren't quite vertical
    or...</p>

    <p>FontForge's Find Problems command can help track down some
    common errors. In some cases it will be able to fix things for
    you, but it won't do so without your permission (who knows,
    some of the so-called "problems" might actually be what you
    wanted), but it will point things out to you that you should
    look at.</p>

    <p>This command works either in the font view, the outline view
    or the metrics view. In the font view it will examine all
    selected glyphs for errors, and if it finds anything open a
    window looking at the glyph and post a (non-modal) dialog
    saying what the error is. You may then correct the problem and
    press the [Next] button in the dialog when you are done, or you
    may stop the command with the [Stop] button. Some errors
    FontForge will be able to fix automagically, and if so there
    will be a [Fix] button in this dlg (<span class=
    "c2"><small><strong>NOTE</strong></small></span>: You should
    not assume that all problems are in fact errors. Some
    "problems" may be intended peculiarities of the font design.
    Don't just blindly press the [Fix] button). Behavior in the
    outline and metrics views is similar, except that only one
    glyph is searched for problems.</p>

    <p>FontForge will be able to check for more problems if
    you:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>AutoHint the font first</li>

      <li>Bring up the <a href=
      "fontinfo.html#Private">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Private</a>
      sub-dialog, add entries for BlueValues, StdHW and StdVW and
      press the [Guess] button for each of them</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note: Some of these problems are geared specifically to the
    problems of Latin/Greek/Cyrillic fonts. I would be happy to
    hear of ways to extend these to other script systems, or of
    problems that are specific to other script systems (<a href=
    "mailto:fontforge-users@lists.sourceforge.net">fontforge-users@lists.sourceforge.net</a>
    this is a public mailing list).</p>

    <p><img src="findprobs.png" width="314" height="479" align=
    "right" />FontForge can detect the following potential
    problems:</p>

    <p><strong><big>Non-Integral Coordinates</big></strong></p>

    <p>In TrueType fonts all coordinates must be on integral
    coordinates. When FontForge generates your font it will round
    any non-integral coordinates -- sometimes this is fine, but it
    can also introduce small uglinesses into your font that you
    won't be aware of in fontforge. (Implied points are allowed to
    have half-integral values (2.5 is ok, 2.25 is not)).</p>

    <p>PostScript fonts can have non-integral coordinates, but it
    will make the font bulkier, so even there it may be better to
    use integer values.</p>

    <p><strong><big>X near [val]</big></strong></p>

    <p>Often there will be a set of features which should be
    consistent across the entire file. For example the left
    side-bearing of the glyphs "BDEFHIKLMNPR" should perhaps all be
    the same. This will let you enter in the desired side-bearing
    value, and then FontForge will find all glyphs with points that
    are near, but not exactly on the desired value. Where "near" is
    defined at the bottom of the dialog (in this case, everything
    within 3 em-units -- in either direction -- will be near). If
    it finds an errant point, FontForge will select it, stop and
    let you fix it.</p>

    <p><strong><big>Y near [val]</big></strong></p>

    <p>This is the exact counter-part of the above command except
    for being in the Y direction. Often times this check is more
    efficiently done by the following check...</p>

    <p><strong><big>Y near standard heights</big></strong></p>

    <p>In Latin, Greek and Cyrillic alphabets there are certain
    standard heights that FontForge expects to find: the baseline,
    the height of lower case letters, the height of capital
    letters, the height of lower case letters with ascenders (often
    the same as, or very close to, the capital height), and the
    depth of lower case letters with descenders. For this command
    FontForge defines these heights to be 0, the height of "x", the
    height of "I", the height of "l" and the depth of "p" (If you
    are working on a Greek or Cyrillic font and don't include the
    Latin alphabet, FontForge will pick similar letters from your
    alphabet). Then FontForge will search for any points which are
    "near", but not on, these heights. Again where "near" is
    defined at the bottom of the dialog. If it finds such a point,
    FontForge will select it, stop and let you fix things.</p>

    <p><strong><big>Control points near
    horizontal/vertical/italic</big></strong></p>

    <p>This is similar to the <a href="problems.html">Edges near
    Horizontal option</a> below, but where that only looks for
    straight lines, this one looks for curved lines that begin or
    end near horizontal (vertical, italic angle).</p>

    <p><strong><big>Control points beyond
    spline</big></strong><img src="cpodd.png" width="210" height=
    "215" align="right" /></p>

    <p>Consider the glyph at right, the selected point has a
    control point that is far outside of what is reasonable and is
    probably not where it should be. This will check for such
    points.</p>

    <p>Technically it will search for all control points, which
    when projected onto the line between the two end points of the
    spline lie outside of the segment between the two.</p>

    <p><strong><big>Irrelevant control points</big></strong></p>

    <p>This will look for control points which are so close to the
    point they modify that they are unlikely to affect the shape of
    the curve. A control point is deemed too close if the distance
    between it and its modified point is less than the "Irrelevant
    Factor" times the distance between the two end points of the
    spline controlled by this control point.</p>

    <p><strong><big>Points Too Close</big></strong></p>

    <p>Some of FontForge's own commands get confused by tiny
    splines, on the order of one unit or less, and anyway if you
    have several points very close together it is unlikely that
    they will make a detectable difference when the font is
    printed. Probably you should remove one of them... If FontForge
    detects two points on the same path which it deems to be too
    close it will select both, stop and let you fix things.</p>

    <p><strong><big>Points Too Far Apart</big></strong></p>

    <p>Most font formats use 16 bit integers to describe the
    distance from one point (or control point) to the next. This
    means that each point must be within 32767 em-units of the next
    point. If it is further away then it cannot be represented in a
    generated font. If FontForge detects two points too far from
    each other it will select both (a special case -- the first
    point in a glyph must be within 32767 of the origin, if it is
    further, only the first point will be selected), stop and let
    you fix things.<br clear="right" /></p>

    <p><img src="findprobs-paths.png" width="307" height="439"
    align="right" /><strong><big>Open Paths</big></strong></p>

    <p>All of your paths should be closed, that is they shouldn't
    have any end points the way a line segment does, but should
    connect back to their beginning. This is often caused by being
    a little careless with the last point on a path, and instead of
    joining it to the first, you just put it near the first. If
    FontForge detects any open paths it will select the entire
    path, and stop to let you fix things up.</p>

    <p><strong><big><a name="Intersecting">Intersecting</a>
    Paths</big></strong></p>

    <p>Both PostScript and TrueType discourage you from having
    intersecting paths in a font.</p>

    <p><strong><big>Edges near
    horizontal/vertical/italic</big></strong></p>

    <p>It is very easy to create a line which is almost, but not
    quite, vertical. This will check for that situation. And for
    horizontal, and (if your font has an italic angle) for lines
    which are almost but not quite parallel to the italic angle. If
    it finds one of these, FontForge will select the two end
    points, stop and let you fix things.</p>

    <p>For horizontal lines it will tell you the y coordinates of
    the two end-points, for vertical lines it will show you the x
    coordinates.</p>

    <p><big><strong>Path Direction</strong></big></p>

    <p>Both PostScript and TrueType require that paths be traced in
    a clockwise fashion. This sometimes doesn't matter, but many
    rasterizers do a better job if this rule is obeyed. This
    command will detect whether this constraint is violated.</p>

    <p><strong>FontForge cannot determine path direction properly
    if there are self-intersecting paths.</strong> <a href=
    "problems.html#Intersecting">Do that test first.</a></p>

    <p>Currently the command will report the same error several
    times if you do not fix the problem. That's sort of a bug, but
    I don't see an easy way around it yet.</p>

    <h3><strong>Check Missing Extrema</strong></h3>

    <p>Both PostScript and TrueType would like you to have points
    at the maxima and minima (the extrema) of a path. This checks
    that you do.</p>

    <h3><strong>More Points Than</strong></h3>

    <p>Appendix B of the PostScript Language Reference manual says
    that an interpreter is only required to support paths with 1500
    points on them. Most interpreters actually have a much higher
    limit, so you may change the limit to suit your desires. I
    believe that control points are included in the count. Note
    that when checking a quadratic font (ie. a truetype font) there
    will be at most one control point between any two end points,
    but when that font gets converted to PostScript there will be
    two. FontForge currently counts this as one point). TrueType
    has no such limit.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h3><strong><img src="findprobs-refs.png" width="307" height=
    "431" align="right" />Flipped References</strong></h3>

    <p>As mentioned above both PostScript and TrueType like
    clockwise paths. If you have a flipped reference then either
    the reference or the original glyph will be drawn with a
    counter-clockwise path. To fix it you should Edit-&gt;Unlink
    the reference and Element-&gt;Correct Direction</p>

    <h3><strong>Refs with bad ttf transformation
    matrices</strong></h3>

    <p>The TrueType glyph format allows almost arbetrary
    transformations to be applied to a reference. The one
    restriction is that all terms of the transformation matrix
    (except for the translation terms) must have a value between -2
    and 2.</p>

    <p>If you have a reference with an unexpressable transformation
    matrix, fontforge will expand the reference inline, so all the
    contours will be present they just won't be in a reference.</p>

    <p>TrueType also requires that all references be translated by
    integral values. If you have a reference with a non-integral
    translation vector, FontForge will round it to an integer when
    it generates the font (this does not cause the reference to be
    unlinked).</p>

    <h3><strong>Mixed contours and references</strong></h3>

    <p>In TrueType glyphs may be composed either of all references
    or all contours (a reference with an unexpressable
    transformation matrix counts as a contour).</p>

    <p>If you have a mixed glyph, fontforge will expand all
    references inline.</p>

    <h3><strong>Refs with bad ps transformation
    matrices</strong></h3>

    <p>The Type1 font format only allows references to be
    translated (so no rotation or scaling is permitted).
    Technically the Type2 format does not allow any references at
    all, but they can be simulated by using subroutines, which also
    cannot be rotated or scaled.</p>

    <p>If you have a reference with an unexpressable transformation
    matrix, fontforge will expand the reference inline, so all the
    contours will be present they just won't be in a reference.</p>

    <h3><strong>Refs Deeper Than</strong></h3>

    <p>Appendix B of the the <a href=
    "http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/5177.Type2.pdf">
    Type2</a> spec says that an interpreter is only required to
    support subroutine nesting up to 10 levels. FontForge uses
    subroutine calls to handle referenced glyphs and sometimes also
    to handle hinting. Hinting will take up a maximum of 1 level of
    subroutine calls leaving 9 available for references. TrueType
    has no such limit.</p>

    <h3><strong>Refs with out of date point matching</strong></h3>

    <p>TrueType allows references to be positioned by aligning
    points in different references. If the point count in one of
    the glyphs being referred changes then you will need to fix up
    these references to match the new point count.<br clear=
    "all" /></p>

    <p><big><strong><img src="findprobs-hint.png" width="314"
    height="489" align="right" />Hints controlling no
    points</strong></big></p>

    <p>This is a bit esoteric, and is present to provide a
    work-around for (what I think is) a bug in ghostview. Consider
    the following glyph</p>

    <p><img src="phi-nohints-outline.png" width="89" height=
    "151" /> <img src="phi-nohints-filled.png" width="93" height=
    "121" /> <img src="phi-hints-outline.png" width="72" height=
    "133" /> <img src="phi-hints-filled.png" width="93" height=
    "125" /><br />
    The first two images show the glyph with no hints, first as
    seen in FontForge, then as displayed by ghostview. The result
    looks good. If we add hints to the two curved stems then
    ghostview gets very confused. I don't know enough about hints
    to know whether there should be hints there. But this command
    will detect this problem if in fact it is a problem. If
    FontForge finds this it will select the offending hint and
    allow you to fix things (probably the best fix is to add curved
    points at the extrema of all the curved splines, this is
    actually recommended by adobe anyway (<a href=
    "http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/T1_Spec.pdf">T1_Spec.pdf</a>
    section 4.1)).</p>

    <p><strong><big>Points near hint edges</big></strong></p>

    <p>If you have a glyph like "H" where the main vertical stems
    are broken by the cross bar, it is all too easy to make the top
    part of the stem a slightly different width than the bottom.
    (The hinting process figures out all the stems.) So this
    command, in essence, is looking for points which are slightly
    off from a stem. (again, near is defined at the bottom of the
    dlg). If FontForge finds such a point it selects it, stops, and
    allows you to fix it up.</p>

    <p><big><strong>Hint width near [val]</strong></big></p>

    <p>Usually one wants many of the glyphs to have a constant stem
    width, and this command will check that all stems near the
    indicated value are that value (again near is defined at the
    bottom of the page). If FontForge finds a bad stem it will
    select it, stop and allow you to fix things.</p>

    <p><big><strong>Almost stem3 hint</strong></big></p>

    <p>PostScript has a special hint operator (hstem3 and vstem3)
    which is designed to hint the stems of things like "m" where
    there are three stems of equal width and equally far apart. It
    is easy for a glyph not to fit the criteria for this operator
    (which means FontForge won't use it). This will detect cases
    that are close to right. I found that I needed to adjust the
    "Near" value to be bigger than the default.</p>

    <p><strong><big>Show exact stem3</big></strong></p>

    <p>(this is not a problem, but I found it helpful to be able to
    distinguish between cases where the "almost stem3" above didn't
    say anything. It might be because it was a stem3 or it might be
    really far off from a stem3)</p>

    <h3><strong>More Hints Than</strong></h3>

    <p>Appendix B of the the <a href=
    "http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/5177.Type2.pdf">
    Type2</a> spec says that an interpreter is only required to
    support a total of 96 horizontal and vertical hints.</p>

    <h3><strong>Overlapped Hints</strong></h3>

    <p>In a PostScript font a glyph should either contain no
    overlapping hints, or it may have a set of hint masks, and each
    mask specifies a set of hints which do not overlap.</p>

    <h3><img src="findprobs-random.png" width="314" height="331"
    align="right" /><strong>Missing Bitmaps</strong></h3>

    <p>Look through the associated bitmap fonts, and find if there
    is a bitmap font which is missing versions of glyphs present in
    the outline font. Conversely look for bitmap fonts with glyphs
    which are not present in the outline font.</p>

    <p><strong><big>Bitmap/Outline Advance Width
    Mismatch</big></strong></p>

    <p>If you have a font with embedded bitmaps, then you would
    expect that the bitmap advance width would be the same as the
    outline glyph's advance width (with approprate scaling and
    rounding, of course). This checks to ensure that that is
    true.</p>

    <p><strong><big>Check Multiple Unicode</big></strong></p>

    <p>Check that you do not have two glyphs assigned to the same
    unicode code point. (The unicode encoding is used to determine
    which glyph will appear in the truetype/opentype 'cmap' table.
    If you have two glyphs with the same code point, there is no
    guarantee which will be used.)</p>

    <p><strong><big>Check Multiple Name</big></strong></p>

    <p>Check that you do not have two glyphs with the same
    name.</p>

    <p><strong><big>Check Unicode/Name mismatch</big></strong></p>

    <p>Look for glyphs whose name indicates a unicode value
    different from the one attached to a glyph. So if a glyph were
    named "A" but had Unicode code point U+0020 (space) FontForge
    would complain about it.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <p><img src="findprobs-bb.png" align="right" width="307"
    height="413" /><big><strong>Glyph BB Above</strong></big></p>

    <p>Find all glyphs whose bounding box extends above the
    indicated value</p>

    <p><big><strong>Glyph BB Below</strong></big></p>

    <p>Find all glyphs whose bounding box extends below the
    indicated value</p>

    <p><big><strong>Glyph BB Right Of</strong></big></p>

    <p>Find all glyphs whose bounding box extends to the right of
    the indicated value</p>

    <p><big><strong>Glyph BB Left Of</strong></big></p>

    <p>Find all glyphs whose bounding box extends to the left of
    the indicated value .</p>

    <p><strong><big><a name="Advance">Check
    Advance</a></big></strong></p>

    <p>Check for any glyphs whose advance width is not the
    specified value (useful for a mono-space font where you want to
    check that all glyphs have the same width).</p>

    <p><strong><big>Check Vertical Advance</big></strong></p>

    <p>Check for any glyphs whose vertical advance (for fonts with
    vertical metrics) differs from the specified value.<br clear=
    "all" /></p>

    <p><img src="findprobs-att.png" width="347" height="304" align=
    "right" /><big><strong>Missing Glyph Names</strong></big></p>

    <p>It is possible to create a substitution, ligature, etc.
    which refers to a glyph name that is not in the font. This
    option will check for the above error.</p>

    <p><big><strong>Missing scripts in features</strong></big></p>

    <p>In OpenType a lookup will only be applied to a glyph if it
    is attached to a feature which is active for the glyph's
    script. So if you had a smallcaps feature which was active for
    latin, and if this invoked a lookup which had also had
    smallcaps data for the greek letters, then that lookup would
    not be invoked for greek even though it could happily make the
    substitution.</p>

    <p>This item will look for cases like the above, where a lookup
    applies to a script which is not active for any of its
    features.</p>

    <p><strong><big>Check substitutions for empty
    chars</big></strong></p>

    <p>Looks through all the 'GSUB' substitution, alternate
    substitution, multiple substitution and ligature entries that
    are attached to the current glyph and checks to make sure that
    all the named components are present in the font (and contain
    something).</p>

    <p><strong><big>Check for incomplete mark to base
    subtables</big></strong></p>

    <p>I find it hard to believe that this is really a problem, but
    I have a second hand report that MicroSoft considers it to be
    so.</p>

    <p>If a mark to base subtable has several anchor classes, then
    all base glyphs must define anchor points for all anchor
    classes.</p>
    <hr clear="all" />

    <p><img src="findprobs-cid.png" width="301" height="418" align=
    "right" />If your font is a CID keyed font you will also
    get:</p>

    <p><strong><big>Check for CIDs defined twice</big></strong></p>

    <p>Looks through the font set to see if there are any CIDs
    which have valid glyphs in two or more fonts.</p>

    <p><strong><big>Check for undefined CIDs</big></strong></p>

    <p>Looks for CIDs which have no glyphs defined for them in any
    font. This is a fairly common occurrence in CID fonts, so use
    this with caution.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <p>At the bottom of the dialog are two buttons (<code>[Clear
    All]</code> and <code>[Set All]</code> which will,
    respectively, clear and set the check boxes for all tests --
    Well, CID tests will not be set by <code>[Set All]</code> in
    non cid-keyed fonts).</p>

    <p>There is also a text field which allows you to define the
    meaning of "Near" as used in various of these tests. The
    default value is that things are "near" if they are within 3
    em-units of the desired value and not equal to that value.</p>
