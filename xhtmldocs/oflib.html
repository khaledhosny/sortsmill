    <h1 class="c1">Open Font Library</h1>

    <p>The <a href="http://openfontlibrary.org/">Open Font
    Library</a> is a web-site which allows you to download
    free/libre/open fonts made by others and to upload your
    own.</p>

    <p>FontForge has commands to make it easy to</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="OFLib.html#Browsing">Browse the library,
      generating font previews, and downloading fonts.</a></li>

      <li><a href="OFLib.html#Uploading">Upload a completed font to
      the library.</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a name="Browsing" id="Browsing"><img src="OFLibBrowse.png"
    align="right" width="603" height="556" />Browsing the
    Library</a></h2>

    <p>The first time this dialog starts it will download a list of
    all fonts on the library. This is an incremental process which
    can take a while. The information is cached and subsequent
    invocations merely check for any additional fonts.</p>

    <p>The display shows the font's name, designer, license and the
    set of tags attached to the font by the designer (and by OFLib
    itself). If you open an entry (by clicking on the emboxed-plus
    sign you will see the separate files you may download.</p>

    <p>In the example at right the font "NotCourier-Sans" from Open
    Source Publishing is selected. This font is released under the
    <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/OFL">Open Font License</a>
    designed by SIL with the help of the community. The package
    just contains a truetype file (which is 104Kb in size).</p>

    <p>If you click on a font and a preview for that font has
    already been downloaded then you will see the preview;
    otherwise you may press the [Preview] button to download it (if
    the package contains no preview then fontforge will download
    the font itself and generate a preview from it).</p>

    <p>If you press the [Open Font] button then fontforge will
    download and open the selected font file.</p>

    <p>You may chose to sort the list of fonts by date, designer,
    or font name. You may also sort it in reverse order. The
    default is to order fonts in reverse chronological order -- so
    the most recent font creations appear first in the list.</p>

    <p>You may restrict the list so that it only shows fonts by a
    certain designer, with a specified license, with certain tags,
    ...<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><img src="generate-upload.png" width="444" height="871"
    align="left" /><a name="Uploading" id="Uploading">Uploading
    Fonts</a></h2>

    <p>When you are generating a font you have the option of
    uploading it to the open font library. Only do this to a
    release version of the font -- it isn't easy to upgrade an
    entry later.</p>

    <p>Before doing this you must <a href=
    "http://openfontlibrary.org/media/register">register with the
    Open Font Library</a> and acquire a username/password
    combination.</p>

    <p>Checking the [*] Upload to Open Font Library will expand the
    <a href="generate.html">Generate Fonts</a> dialog with fields
    containing the information needed to upload a font to the
    library.</p>

    <p>First (obviously) you need the username/password combination
    you acquired earlier. FontForge will remember these for you if
    you want, but the information is barely encrypted when FF
    stores it (of course the password goes across the internet as
    plain text, so having minimal encryption on your computer may
    be the least of your worries).</p>

    <p>You need to identify the font with a name on the OFLibrary
    site. Generally the fontname will do, but you could chose
    something else.</p>

    <p>If you had any collaborators, or if you based this on some
    earlier work list these people in "Artists".</p>

    <p>The OFLib identifies fonts by keyword tags. You may list as
    many comma separated tags as you wish, and you may use pretty
    much anything as a tag. It should be something that will help
    identify your font of course. So "sans_serif", "bold",
    "condensed", "italic", might all be good tags. The server will
    automagically add tags containing the font type (otf/ttf/etc.)
    and the license.</p>

    <p>You also need to specify a description of the font.</p>

    <p>You must specify a license. The OFLib currently accepts only
    two licenses (Open Font License and Public Domain). If your
    font is not licensed with either of these you should not upload
    it.</p>

    <p>Linux packagers appreciate it if you also include the
    license in a separate text file. If your font contains a
    license (see <a href="fontinfo.html#TTF-Names">Element-&gt;Font
    Info-&gt;TTF Names-&gt;License</a>) then FontForge will extract
    this information and send it up as a separate file. (Currently
    the OFLib does not accept this information. I hope that will
    change).</p>

    <p>It your font is released under the Open Font License then
    you should also upload a FontLog file. Again FontForge will do
    that for you if your font has FONTLOG information
    (Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;FontLog). (Currently the OFLib does
    not accept this information either).</p>

    <p>You should also submit a font preview, an image of your font
    in use. You may create one yourself and browse for it on the
    disk (using the [...] button), or you may ask fontforge to
    generate a somewhat generic one for you. FontForge searches the
    font for all the scripts in it and then displays the alphabets
    of those scripts (at least that's what it does for alphabets,
    for CJK it will display a small selection of the defined
    glyphs). You can see an example of a fontforge generated
    preview for NotCourier-Sans <a href=
    "OFLib.html#Browsing">above</a></p>

    <p>Finally you may mark that your font is "Not safe for use in
    a work environment" I'm not sure what font would fall into that
    catagory (I think it is part of the common interface with the
    open clip art library), perhaps a font where the glyph stems
    were nude figures or some such.</p>

    <p>Pressing [Save] will first save the font on the local disk,
    and then upload it to the OFLib -- obviously you must be
    connected to the internet for this to work.</p>
