    <p>For entering text in CJK languages, simple keyboard typing
    is not adequate. Instead there are programs that run and handle
    the conversion of keystrokes to characters these programs are
    called input methods.</p>

    <p>I have tested FontForge with two freely available input
    methods (as well as one can who speaks neither Chinese,
    Japanese nor Korean) kinput2 (for Japanese) and <a href=
    "http://xcin.linux.org.tw/">xcin</a> (for Chinese).</p>

    <p>There is reasonably good (English) documentation on
    installing and using kinput2 on the mozilla site, and at
    <a href=
    "http://www.suse.de/~mfabian/suse-cjk/kinput2.html">suse</a>,
    kinput2 has the interesting complexity that it requires yet
    another server to be running, generally either cannaserver or
    jserver. It looks to me as though it might be possible to use a
    chinese or korean jserver with kinput2 but I have not tried
    this.</p>

    <p>There is good Chinese and English documentation on xcin at
    the <a href="http://xcin.linux.org.tw/">xcin site in Taiwan</a>
    (english is not the default here, but it is available about 3
    lines down).</p>

    <p>One of the most difficult problems I had in installing these
    was finding the appropriate locales. I could not find them in
    my RedHat 7.3 distribution, nor could I find any RedHad rpms
    containing them. There is a good supply of Mandrake locale rpms
    (named <code>locales-zh*</code> for chinese,
    <code>locales-jp*</code> for japanese, etc.) but Mandrake
    stores them in a different directory so after installing them I
    had to copy them from <code>/usr/share/locales</code> to
    <code>/usr/lib/locales</code>. The SUSE docs imply that the
    current SUSE distribution ships with these locales.</p>

    <p>To start fontforge with an input method you must first
    insure that the input method itself is running. For kinput2 do
    the following:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
$ cannaserver &amp;
$ kinput2 -canna -xim &amp;
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>While for xcin:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
$ setenv LC_CTYPE zh_TW.Big5             (or $ LC_CTYPE=zh_TW.Big5 ; export LC_CTYPE )
$ xcin &amp;
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Beware: Different systems will have slightly different
    locale names (sometimes it's <code>zh_TW.big5</code>, or
    something else) so if things don't work try something else.</p>

    <p>Once you've started your input method you must then start
    FontForge. You should set the LC_CTYPE environment variable (or
    LC_ALL or LANG) to the appropriate locale. You may (if you have
    multiple input methods running that support the same locale)
    need to set the XMODIFIERS environment variable to the name of
    your method (xcin can have multiple names, it prints out the
    one it is currently using on start-up).</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
$ setenv LC_CTYPE ja_JP.eucJP
$ setenv XMODIFIERS "@im=kinput2"
$ fontforge -new
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>FontForge will start up significantly more slowly when
    connecting to an IM, just be patient with it. FontForge
    supports OverTheSpot input in textfields and Root input in the
    font and outline character views. Not all textfields accept
    unicode input, but any that do should now accept input from an
    IM.</p>

    <p class="c1"><small><strong>This only works if
    <code>X_HAVE_UTF8_STRING</code> is defined -- an XFree 4.0.2
    extension (ie. not on solaris)</strong></small></p>
