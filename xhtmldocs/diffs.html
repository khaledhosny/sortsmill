    <h2>Differences from <a href=
    "http://www.macromedia.com/software/fontographer/">Fontographer</a></h2>

    <ul>
      <li>FontForge supports OpenType</li>

      <li>FontForge supports scripting</li>

      <li>FontForge understands GPOS/GSUB/GDEF tables as well as
      morx/prop/etc.</li>

      <li>The font window can display the outline font at various
      pixelsizes</li>

      <li>The font window can display a bitmap font instead

        <ul>
          <li>(if it does then double clicking on a character will
          open a bitmap editor)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>The metrics window also lets you look at the bitmap fonts
      (but doesn't let you change their metrics, except by changing
      those of the outline font).</li>

      <li>Supports many more international standard encodings,
      allows you to create your own encodings. Better unicode
      support. Can generate type0 fonts for 2byte encodings.
      Support for some 94x94 CJK encodings (like JISX208)</li>

      <li>There's a command to jump to any particular character in
      the font, outline or bitmap windows. Characters may be
      entered by name, local encoding, ku ten (for CJK fonts), and
      unicode name.</li>

      <li>If you change the width of a character then all that
      character's bitmaps will automagically have their widths
      changed. Also if the character is used as a reference in any
      other character, and that other character had the same width
      then it's width will also be updated (as will the widths of
      any of its bitmaps)</li>

      <li>If you change the lbearing of a character (if you
      translate all elements in the foreground of an outline
      character, and the translation is only in the x direction)
      then all hints will also be translated, and if the character
      is a letter, then any characters which depend on it will have
      all other elements translated by the same amount. (So if you
      move the character "A" then the reference to tilde in "Ã"
      will be moved to correspond)</li>

      <li>There's a command to build an <a name="accented" id=
      "accented">accented</a> character.

        <p>The base characters should already have been created.
        Select an accented character (or several of them) in the
        font view and press <code>Build Accented Chars</code> from
        the <code>Element</code> menu.</p>

        <p>Suppose you select À, then Unicode says this is made up
        of the characters 0x0041 and 0x0300. Now 0x0300 is not
        present in most postscript fonts, but it is sort of
        synonymous with either 0x02CB or 0x0060 which often are
        present. Unicode also says that 0x0300 floats on top of and
        centered horizontally over the base character. So...</p>

        <p>A reference to "A" will be placed into "À", and that
        character will be given the same width as "A". Then a
        reference to "`" will be centered on "A" and placed above
        it. Something similar will be done in any bitmaps.</p>

        <p>Some Unicode characters contain more than one accent.
        Additional accents will be treated similarly. This command
        can also be used to generate more general composite
        characters. Unicode 0x2163 is the roman numeral IV and this
        command may be used to build it. Greek capital Alpha looks
        exactly like Latin capital A and can be created. On the
        other hand the oe ligature will be replaced by an "o"
        followed by "e", so be a little careful. Some accents (for
        example cedilla) are treated unexpectedly on certain
        letters (different ways in different languages), so be
        careful of g-cedilla. Å often merges the ring into the top
        of the A, but here it will float above it. Be careful.</p>

        <p><span class=
        "c1"><strong><small>NOTE:</small></strong></span> My
        centering algorithms attempt to guess what will look
        centered to the human eye (centering it in the middle of
        the character will often not look centered). You should
        examine all built characters and be prepared to adjust the
        accent.<br />
        The algorithms take some account of the italicangle.</p>
      </li>

      <li>There's a merge font command. This is designed to allow
      you to build one monster unicode font out of several smaller
      fonts. It will prompt for a font to merge into the current
      one, and then will copy any characters which not in the
      current font and put them there. Note both fonts must be
      properly encoded.</li>

      <li>You can control what you want copy to copy in the font
      window. By default if you select "A" then and press copy then
      it will copy the outline description and all the bitmap
      descriptions for "A", so when you paste it, the bitmaps will
      follow the outline. You can choose instead just to copy from
      the font that is being displayed (which might be the outline
      font or might be a bitmap). When you Paste, whatever is in
      the clipboard will be pasted.

        <p>Transform sometimes will transform bitmaps, but not all
        transformations map into bitmap transforms.</p>
      </li>

      <li>Most changes are preserved across crashes.</li>

      <li>Right clicking in the character and bitmap windows will
      produce a menu of tools</li>

      <li>The bitmap window has a number of (not very useful) tools
      which fontographer didn't include. They are only available
      from the menu (not from palettes)

        <ul>
          <li>Rectangle</li>

          <li>Filled Rectangle</li>

          <li>Ellipse</li>

          <li>Filled Ellipse</li>

          <li>Flip horizontal/vertical</li>

          <li>Rotate 90° Clockwise/Counter Clockwise</li>

          <li>Rotate 180°</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
