Advice on how to contribute.
----------------------------

(This is a work in progress.)

* As of right now, we are going to use GNU Indent with the --gnu-style
  setting.

* New code should be written in small functions with low cyclomatic
  complexity, preferably 10 or less. To measure complexity, use the
  pmccabe program: http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/pmccabe

  A Gentoo ebuild for pmccabe is here:
  https://github.com/chemoelectric/chemoelectric-overlay/tree/master/dev-util/pmccabe

* New code should be well structured. Roughly speaking, this means
  avoiding a lot of C idioms. Following these practices will help
  minimize the complexity. Do not worry too much about structured code
  being inefficient compared to code employing zany C idioms.

  * Avoid goto.

  * Avoid continue.

  * Avoid break from a loop.

  * There should be one return from the function, at the bottom.

  * Try to avoid any but the most simple and obvious for-loops. Use a
    while-loop or do-while loop instead.

  * Avoid assignment inside an expression.

  * Avoid ++ and -- inside an expression.

  * Avoid side effects as much as possible within the constraints of
    the C language.

  * Write switch and case statements nicely, each case having exactly
    one break, at the bottom. (It is okay to include a break at the
    bottom of the default branch.)

  * Use C99. In particular, use variable-length arrays to allocate
    space automatically on the stack. Try to avoid arbitrary sizes.
    (This includes even MAX_PATH; I believe that on GNU/Hurd there is
    no MAX_PATH.)
