        To my surprise, it made things worse in one of my test cases, and
        barely registered an improvement in another.  So I think we're
        better off without it. But I don't understand why things are
        worse so I'm leaving the code in to play with. FIXME: This
        might have been due to the sizeof bug that I (Barry Schwartz)
        fixed, so we might turn this feature on someday. To try that now,
        set this variable to 1.])
