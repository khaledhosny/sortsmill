    <p>Allows you to create or modify a multiple master font</p>

    <h2><a name="MM" id="MM">What is a multiple master
    font?</a></h2>

    <p>A multiple master font is a (<a href=
    "http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/5015.Type1_Supp.pdf">PostScript
    Type1</a>) font which contains, in one font description several
    extreme styles of a font family and code for interpolating
    between them to produce intermediate designs. Apple has a
    <a href=
    "http://developer.apple.com/fonts/TTRefMan/RM06/Chap6fvar.html">
    similar concept</a> for TrueType -- The only name I've seen
    given to this is "Apple Distortable Font" -- I call both
    multiple master.</p>

    <p>A multiple master font has several axes along which
    variation may occur. For example a font might allow variation
    along the Weight axis (everything from Thin to Black), along
    the Width axis (Condensed to Extended) and along the Optical
    Size axis (from 6pt to 72pt). The Type1 spec requires that
    there be a design for every extreme combination along each
    axis. In the above example there should be:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Thin Condensed 6pt</li>

      <li>Thin Condensed 72pt</li>

      <li>Thin Extended 6pt</li>

      <li>Thin Extended 72pt</li>

      <li>Black Condensed 6pt</li>

      <li>Black Condensed 72pt</li>

      <li>Black Extended 6pt</li>

      <li>Black Extended 72pt</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A font designer may also add intermediate designs as
    well.</p>

    <p>From these extreme designs PostScript is able to interpolate
    any intermediate style desired (as Normal Normal 12pt).</p>

    <p>Apple has a slightly different format, not only must the
    extreme designs be specified but the default designs must be as
    well (so Apple requires 3 designs per axis as opposed to 2 for
    PostScript). In the above example there would be 27
    designs:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Thin Condensed 6pt</li>

      <li>Thin Condensed 12pt</li>

      <li>Thin Condensed 72pt</li>

      <li>Thin 6pt</li>

      <li>Thin 12pt</li>

      <li>Thin 72pt</li>

      <li>Thin Extended 6pt</li>

      <li>Thin Extended 12pt</li>

      <li>Thin Extended 72pt</li>

      <li>Regular Condensed 6pt</li>

      <li>...</li>

      <li>Black Extended 72pt</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Apple also allows for intermediate designs, but FontForge
    does not currently support this.</p>

    <p>A font designer first determines how many axes s/he will
    need. PostScript allows a maximum of 4 axes in a Type1 font.
    FontForge only supports 4 axes for Apple's fonts too.</p>

    <p>Then s/he provides information about each axis,
    specifically:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The axis type (Weight, Width, Optical Size, etc)</li>

      <li>The range of design values over which this axis will
      vary<br />
      Typically 1-999 for Weight and Width (1 being extremely thin
      or condensed, 999 being extremely black or extended) or 6-72
      for Optical Size<br />
      Apple fonts seem to have a different default range,
      .05-2.0</li>

      <li>A mapping from the design value range to the range [0 1]
      called the normalized range. (Apple maps to [-1,1] with the
      default design mapped to 0)<br />
      This mapping is piecewise linear. Generally it will just be
      the obvious (1=&gt;0.0, 999=&gt;1.0) but it is possible to
      add intermediate points so that 500=&gt;.3 which would give a
      different scaling between 1&amp;500 than between
      500&amp;999.</li>

      <li>In an apple distortable font, each axis must be given a
      name which may be translated into multiple languages.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Then s/he determines the number of designs needed. In a
    Type1 font there may be at most 16, and at least 2^axis-count.
    So in a 3 axis font there must be at least 8 designs, one for
    each extreme.</p>

    <p>For Type1 fonts s/he needs to write two postscript
    functions</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>NormalizeDesignVector</dt>

      <dd>FontForge is always able to generate this function for
      the user (unless the user wants something non-linear). This
      maps a vector of design values to their normalized values (in
      our three axis case above it might map [400 500 12] to [.4 .5
      .09])</dd>

      <dt>ConvertDesignVector</dt>

      <dd>In the usual cases FontForge is able to create this
      function for the user (but in more complicated cases, with
      intermediate designs it is unable to do so). This function
      takes a normalized vector (as produced above) and figures out
      how much each weight to give each design in the final
      blend.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Finally s/he provides a default vector of design weights
    (one for each design). This will be used when the multiple
    master font is used without any additional information being
    provided. It should describe the normal variant of the font.
    The sum of all the weights must be 1.0. In the above example,
    if we take [400 500 12] as our definition of "normal" this
    vector might look like: [.273 .027 .273 .027 .182 .018 .182
    .018].</p>

    <p>Apple distortable fonts do not need the postscript
    functions, nor the default weight vector mentioned above.
    Instead they need a set of named styles which map a particular
    coordinate in design space to a name (which may be provided in
    several languages).</p>

    <p>Corresponding glyphs in each design must have certain
    similarities:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>There must be the same number of contours (or
      references)</li>

      <li>There must be the same number of points on each
      contour</li>

      <li>Corresponding contours must be oriented in the same
      direction</li>

      <li>In a Type1 fonts there must be corresponding hints, and
      hint substitution points.</li>

      <li>In a TrueType font corresponding glyphs share the same
      instructions (and 'fpgm' and 'prep' tables), but may have
      different 'cvt ' tables.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Dialog</h2>

    <p>This dialog is used for creating and modifying multiple
    master fonts. It contains several sub-dialogs which must be
    processed in sequence, and follows pretty closely to the
    process described above. I will first show the sequence for
    Adobe's fonts, and then explain Apple's fonts.</p>

    <p><img src="mmcounts.png" width="476" height="448" align=
    "right" />The first screen allows you to choose the type of
    distortable font you wish to generate (Adobe Multiple Master,
    or Apple), the number of axes in your font, and the number of
    master designs, and a family name (which will be used for
    creating new fonts, if you need any new ones).<br clear=
    "all" /></p>

    <p><img src="mmaxes.png" width="476" height="448" align=
    "right" />The second screen gives you control of each axis.
    There are a few standard axis types defined by Adobe (and by
    Apple), but you could define your own. Note that there are
    fields which are disabled here, they only apply to Apple's
    fonts.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <p><img src="mmdesigns.png" width="476" height="448" align=
    "right" />Then you must assign a font to each of the master
    designs. You can either have FontForge create a new font for
    you (as here), or use an already loaded font, or browse your
    disk for a font (don't try to use the same font twice).</p>

    <p>You must also specify the coordinates of this design along
    the axes. If you use the minimum number of designs they will
    all be extremes and the coordinate values will be either 0 or
    1. Unless you are working with intermediate designs it is best
    to let FontForge initialize this field for you.<br clear=
    "all" /></p>

    <p><img src="mmfuncs.png" width="476" height="448" align=
    "right" />This screen shows the postscript functions needed to
    map a design vector to a weight vector (ie. given positions on
    each of the design axes, these produce blending coefficients
    for each master design). In most useful case FontForge is able
    to generate these functions automatically, but if you use
    intermediate designs things get too complicated for FontForge
    and you must enter the functions manually.<br clear=
    "all" /></p>

    <p><img src="mmfinal.png" width="476" height="448" align=
    "right" />The last screen shows the default weights (which you
    may either enter directly or as coordinates along the design
    axes), the ForceBoldThreshold private dictionary
    entry).<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h3>An Apple distortable font.</h3>

    <p><img src="mmappleaxes.png" width="476" height="448" align=
    "right" />The dialog looks very similar, but there are a few
    differences. In the Axis pane of the dlg, you must also specify
    a default value for the axis, and a translatable
    name.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <p><img src="mmnamedstyles.png" width="476" height="448" align=
    "right" />Apple allows coordinates in design space to be named.
    Here the name "Black" is given to the location where Weight=3.2
    (the darkest value) and <img src="mmnamingastyle.png" width=
    "368" height="470" align="left" />Width=1 (the default value).
    Again these names can be translated into multiple
    languages.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2>A suggestion</h2>

    <p>Adobe's Type1 fonts require all the extreme designs to be
    specified, so that for a 3 axis multiple master font, you need
    8 designs. This is because Adobe only seems to expect
    interpolation to be used. On the other hand in many cases
    extrapolation can be used to generate some of these designs. In
    the 3 axis case you only need to produces 4 designs (one for
    the base, and one each to express the variation on each
    axis).</p>

    <p>I will describe the 2 axis case in detail (because it is
    easier to visualize): Suppose you have a font which varies on
    the Weight axis from 50 to 900, and on the Width axis from 100
    to 1000. And suppose you have created fonts for
    Weight=50,Width=100 &amp; Weight=50, Width=100 &amp;
    Weight=900,Width=100. Call these designs 0, 1 and 2. We wish to
    produce a design, 3, with Weight=900, Width=1000.</p>

    <p class="c2"><img src="mmextrapolate2.png" width="132" height=
    "132" /></p>

    <p>First we must produce an intermediate design (which we will
    delete later), call it "I". Use FontForge's
    Element-&gt;Interpolate Fonts command to produce a design which
    is 50% of the way from design 1 to design 2 (This will be
    Weight=475, Width=550). Then produce another design with is
    200% of the way from design 0 to design "I". This will be the
    desired extreme design.</p>

    <p>Adobe's Type2 designs appear to have been prepared to allow
    this approach, but the multiple master operators were dropped
    from the Type2 spec, and the question is moot.</p>
