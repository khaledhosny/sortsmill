    <h1 class="c1">Building Accented and other Composite
    Glyphs</h1>

    <p>You can use the <kbd>Element-&gt;Build-&gt;Build Accented
    Glyph</kbd> command to build up accented glyphs. Or you can use
    <kbd>Element-&gt;Build-&gt;Build Composite</kbd> and build
    slightly more general composite glyphs (ligatures and so
    forth). The accented version will not create ligatures and will
    not replace Alpha with A. The composite version will do both
    these things. My assumption is that ligatures (like the "fi"
    ligature) usually need a bit of work on the user's part to get
    them to look good, in the case of "fi" the dot on the "i" needs
    to be fused into the hook of the "f", and if you are careless
    with the command you might destroy your work inadvertently.</p>

    <p>What can be built?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Unicode specifies various normative glyph decompositions.
      So "Aacute" is defined to be an "A" with an "acute" accent
      centered on top. Any of these can be built (though if the
      glyph contains no accents it will need to be built with the
      build composite command).<br />
        Sometimes Unicode's normative definition is not as
        informative as it might be (many of the greek accents are
        "unified" with latin accents that they don't really look
        like, the result is that following Unicode slavishly will
        yield the wrong glyph). So in some cases FontForge will use
        a slightly different set of glyphs than the normative
        decomposition.<br />
        This includes:

        <ul>
          <li>Latin accented characters</li>

          <li>Latin ligatures (ae, oe, fi, fl, etc)</li>

          <li>Greek accented characters</li>

          <li>Cyrillic accented characters</li>

          <li>Hebrew ligatures</li>

          <li>Arabic ligatures</li>

          <li>Fractions, digits inside parens, roman numerals,
          etc.</li>

          <li>The predefined Hangul characters (0xac00-0xdfaf)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Many of the Korean Jamo are actually ligatures of other
      Jamo (ssangkiyoeok (0x1101) is composed of two kiyoeok
      (0x1100)). For some reason this information is not normative
      unicode, but FontForge is aware of it anyway and will build
      those glyphs if you ask it to.</li>

      <li>The glyphs "i" and "j" can be built by adding a dot
      accent to the dotlessi and dotlessj glyphs</li>

      <li>The dotlessi and dotlessj glyphs can be built by removing
      the dot from an "i" or "j" glyph</li>

      <li>If a glyph name has an extension, as "agrave.sc", then it
      will be built out of the same components as "agrave", except
      FontForge will use the variants of those components named
      with the same extension. So "agrave.sc" would be built out of
      "a.sc" and "grave.sc". If the accent variant does not exist
      then FontForge will also try the bare accent "grave".</li>

      <li>FontForge knows a few other things. It knows that Greek
      "Alpha" and Cyrillic A both look like the Latin "A" and will
      replace either if you ask. (as well as all the other similar
      glyphs in latin, greek, cyrillic, cherokee, etc.)</li>

      <li>Some glyphs are just extremely simple to build. There are
      a whole slew of glyphs which correspond to zero-width spaces.
      FontForge will build any of them. More usefully it will build
      any of the fixed size spaces 0x2000-0x200f, and the fixed
      sized rules 0x2010-0x2015).</li>

      <li>You may use the Element-&gt;Char Info dialog to define a
      ligature yourself, and FontForge will build it for you.</li>

      <li>In Adobe's CID glyph sets there are some pre-rotated
      versions of latin glyphs. When CJK text is written vertically
      the convention is that any text in western alphabets should
      be displayed rotated 90º clockwise. If you apply Build
      Accented Glyph to one of these slots it will find the
      appropriate latin letter and rotate it properly.<br />
      If a glyph's name is "vertcid_&lt;cid&gt;" where &lt;cid&gt;
      is a decimal number, then it is assumed to be a vertically
      rotated version of the glyph at &lt;cid&gt;. In non-cid-keyed
      fonts, if a glyph's name is "vertuni&lt;uni&gt;" where
      &lt;uni&gt; is a four digit hex number, then it is assumed to
      be a vertically rotated version of that unicode glyph.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So for each selected glyph in the font view (or for the
    current glyph in the outline view), and if all the base glyphs
    and accents needed by the glyph have already been created then
    this command will delete anything that is in the current
    layerand put a reference to the base glyph and another
    reference to the accent glyph into the foreground. So if the
    current glyph were "À" then a reference to "A" would be added
    to it, and a reference to "`" would be centered above the
    "A".<br />
    If <a href="editmenu.html#From">Copy From</a> is set to All
    Fonts then any bitmaps will have a similar process done -- that
    is to say, bitmap references will be created (even in the
    outline glyph view).</p>

    <p>Choosing accents can be a slightly tricky process. Unicode
    says that accented letters are logically built out of the
    accents in the range 0x300-0x340, but this does not work too
    well in postscript. A Type1 font works better if the accented
    glyph is in the Adobe Standard Encoding, which means either
    using accents around 0x2d0 or ascii glyphs. FontForge will
    first attempt to find an accent around 0x2d0, then in ascii and
    finally in the 0x300-0x340 range. Even worse, Unicode unifies
    the greek and latin accents, so for greek letters FontForge
    will look for accents around 0x1fbd (FontForge will also
    require the presence of the double accents like 0x1fdd).</p>

    <p>Some of Adobe's fonts have accents designed for use over
    upper case letters (the nomal accents are designed for lower
    case), and accents designed for use over cyrillic letters. So
    in such a font, if you attempt to build "Agrave" FontForge will
    build it out of "A" and "Grave" (or "grave.cap", not the
    standard "grave").</p>

    <p>Not all accents should be centered above the base glyph, a
    cedilla is (usually) centered underneath the base, while other
    accents need to be placed to the left or right, or even
    overstruck. FontForge should know about proper placement of
    most accents (or at least a rough approximation thereto).</p>

    <p>Some Unicode glyphs contain more than one accent. Additional
    accents will be treated similarly. This command can also be
    used to generate more general composite glyphs .</p>

    <p>Some accents (for example cedilla) are treated unexpectedly
    on certain letters (different ways in different languages), so
    be careful of g-cedilla. Å often merges the ring into the top
    of the A, but here it will float above it. <span class=
    "c2"><strong>Be alert</strong></span>.</p>

    <p>Placing an accent above a glyph is surprisingly tricky.
    Centered accents (like grave, acute, etc.) should not really be
    placed in the exact center of the glyph. For instance when
    placing an acute accent on top of an "a" the accent should
    actually go above the highest part of the "a" which is almost
    but not quite in the center of the glyph. And when placing an
    acute on top of a "k" (a rare combination, but still used) the
    accent is centered on the stem of the "k". Greek accents are
    even more baroque. FontForge knows many oddities of accent
    placement, but it will never know all of them (some letters
    have multiple forms depending on the font, or perhaps on the
    humidity and phase of the moon).</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="2" align="center">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p class="c3"><img src="acenter.png" width="208" height=
          "281" /><br />
          Center point of the glyph</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p class="c3"><img src="ahighest.png" width="208" height=
          "281" /><br />
          Highest point of the glyph</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>And how accents are centered depends on the accents
    themselves. Usually FontForge will try to center an accent so
    that the accent's center is over the base glyph's "center". But
    that doesn't always work either. The grave and acute accents
    are usually (but not always) centered only on the bottom part
    of the glyph.</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="2" align="center">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p class="c3"><img src="aacutemid.png" width="131"
          height="228" /><br />
          Midpoint of accent</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p class="c3"><img src="aacutebase.png" width="132"
          height="225" /><br />
          Centered on base of accent</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>FontForge gives you a minuscule amount of control over where
    it puts accents. There are two preference items you can set
    (<a href="filemenu.html#prefs">File-&gt;Preferences</a>)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>AccentOffsetPercent -- This allows you to control the
      amount of space between the top of the letter and the bottom
      of the accent (or the bottom of the letter and the top of the
      accent for accents that sink under their letters). This is
      expressed as a percentage of the em size and defaults to 6%.
      (In some cases there will be a little bit more space above
      the accent than that. All the accents from all the lower case
      letters should be at the same height, but the letter "o" is
      usually slightly higher than the letter "u". So all the lower
      case accents will be placed at the appropriate height for
      "o", even those over "u". A similar trick is done for upper
      case letters).</li>

      <li>AcuteCenterBottom -- This controls whether acute and
      grave (and double acute and grave) accents are centered on
      the entire glyph, or just on the bottom.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><span class=
    "c2"><strong><small>NOTE:</small></strong></span> So FontForge
    is going to do something wrong. There are just too many areas
    where I am ignorant or my taste doesn't match yours or the
    program has a bug. I strongly recommend that you examine all
    your accented glyphs after building them and be prepared to
    adjust things.</p>

    <p>The algorithms take some account of the italicangle, but
    when working on an italic (or oblique) font FontForge is even
    more likely to do something you don't like.</p>

    <p>If all else fails you can build your own accented glyphs
    with <a href="editmenu.html#Reference">Edit-&gt;Copy
