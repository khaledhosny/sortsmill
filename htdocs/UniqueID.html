Subject: [OpenType] Why you don't need UniqueIDs
Date:   Fri, 04 Mar 2005 10:04:41 -0800
</pre>

      <p>Neither Type 1 nor OpenType CFF fonts require PostScript
      UniqueIDs.</p>

      <p>Back in the mid-80s, when printing might be done on a 57K
      serial connection and printers might have 8 MHz processors,
      the caching of device-generated bitmaps enabled by UniqueIDs
      made a noticeable speed difference. With today's connection
      bandwidths and printers, the printing speed difference was
      insignificant in our tests (conducted around 2002), and
      certainly not enough to outweigh the risks of collisions
      between UniqueIDs for different fonts and the trouble of
      tracking the ID numbers.</p>

      <p>For these reasons, Adobe stopped using UniqueIDs (and
      XUIDs) in our own OpenType CFF fonts. If we still made Type 1
      fonts, we wouldn't use UniqueIDs for them, either.</p>

      <p>You may of course continue to use UniqueIDs, it's just
      that they are not necessary.</p>

      <p>Regards,</p>

      <p>T</p>
