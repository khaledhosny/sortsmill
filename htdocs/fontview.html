    <h1 class="c2">Font View</h1>

    <p><img src="AmbrosiaFV.png" width="423" height="226" /></p>

    <p>The font view is a list of all the glyphs available in the
    given font.</p>

    <p>You may chose to display it at various sizes, by default it
    will be displayed with the outline font rasterized on a 24
    pixel em square. You may display it at 36, 48, 72 and 96 pixel
    sizes as well. You may also choose to look at an anti-aliased
    greymap (the above image is anti-aliased). These are slower to
    generate but look nicer (<a href=
    "AA-Comparison.html">Comparison</a>).</p>

    <p>If you have an encoding slot which has nothing in it (as
    opposed to an encoding which maps to a space glyph) then that
    will be shown by a faint red X drawn across the box.</p>

    <p>Above each image of the glyphs in the font is a label
    indicating the glyph in some conventional format. Usually this
    is just a small image of the glyph in a standard font (as it is
    above), but you can change it to show the glyph's name, unicode
    code point or encoding (in hex). In small views (24 pixel view
    for instance) there may not be room for the entire label, and
    it will appear truncated.</p>

    <p><img src="fvOutOfDateHinting.png" width="99" height="66"
    align="left" />If a glyph has been changed since it was last
    hinted (PostScript), or if a glyph contains contours but has no
    instructions (TrueType), then its label will be edged with blue
    bars. If the glyph has out of date instructions (TrueType),
    then its label will be edged with red.</p>

    <p>If one of your glyphs has something in its background layer
    then this will be indicated visually (currently by darkening
    the background of the glyph label).</p>

    <p>Normally the view will display the foreground layer of the
    font, but you may change it to display any layer (other than
    the background layer) with <code><a href=
    "viewmenu.html#FVLayers">View-&gt;Layers-&gt;?</a></code></p>

    <p>You may also display any of the bitmap fonts you have
    generated from the outline glyphs. Simply go to the View menu
    and select the one you want.</p>

    <p>If you look at a bitmap version of the font, and it does not
    contain a glyph for which there is an outline glyph (ie. the
    font needs its bitmaps regenerated) then the missing glyph will
    be outlined in red to bring it to your attention more
    easily.</p>

    <p>Small bitmap fonts will be magnified. If the pixelsize of
    the font is less than 10 it will be shown 3 times normal size,
    if less than 20 twice normal size.</p>

    <p>Underneath the menu bar is some information on the last
    glyph selected. First is the encoding of the glyph in the
    current font expressed in decimal. Next is the unicode code
    point for the glyph (or ???? if it is not a unicode character).
    Next the postscript name for the glyph, and finally the unicode
    name. Not all unicode characters will have unicode names (the
    CJK characters do not for example)</p>

    <p>If you move the cursor to a glyph and let it rest there a
    small popup window will appear containing information about
    that glyph. If you depress the control key then this window is
    locked in place until you move the mouse.</p>

    <p>You may display <a name="metrics" id="metrics">metrics</a>
    lines (baseline, origin and advance width) in the font view.
    (View -&gt; Show H Metrics). If you do so, I suggest viewing
    the font at a large pixel size, otherwise the window looks too
    confusing.</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="2">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p class="c1"><img src="FVHMetrics.png" width="100"
          height="116" /></p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p class="c1"><img src="FVVMetrics.png" width="100"
          height="116" /></p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr valign="top">
        <td>A 96 pixel display showing the various horizontal
        metric lines.<br />
        The blue line is the baseline<br />
        The small red tick on the left marks the glyph
        origin.<br />
        The green line on the right shows where the advance width
        is&nbsp;while the bottom green line shows how long it
        is.&nbsp;(normally you will not display both at once)<br />
        The glyph is centered horizontally, and the font ascent is
        the top of the box displaying it, while the descent is the
        bottom.</td>

        <td>A 96 pixel display showing the various vertical metric
        lines.<br />
        The blue line down the center is the vertical
        baseline.<br />
        The red bar at the top (over writing the ascent line) is
        the&nbsp;vertical origin.<br />
        The green line at the bottom shows where the vertical
        advance &nbsp;is while the green line on the right shows
        how long it is. &nbsp;(normally you will not display both
        at once)</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>You may select any number of glyphs in the font by dragging
    through them. You may use shift-click to select (or deselect)
    additional glyphs. You may also use the arrow keys to move
    around (and shift-arrow to select). To some extent the order
    you select glyphs in will be remembered and a few commands will
    make use of that.</p>

    <p>You may drag and drop selected glyphs into</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>The metrics view</dt>

      <dd>Where they will be inserted into the display before the
      selected glyph (selected in the metrics view) in the order in
      which you selected them in the font view.</dd>

      <dt>The outline view</dt>

      <dd>Where they will appear as references</dd>

      <dt>The glyph info substitutions/ligature dlg</dt>

      <dd>Where they will appear as a substitution or
      ligature.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>The [Tab] key will move to the next glyph with something in
    it, and Shift-[Tab] will move to the previous glyph with
    something interesting.</p>

    <p>You can perform various operations on the selected
    glyphs:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Apply a general transformation (ie. move 20 units right
      and then rotate 180°)</li>

      <li>Expand all paths to be stroked paths</li>

      <li>Clean up areas where several paths intersect</li>

      <li>Simplify paths</li>

      <li>Build Accented Characters</li>

      <li>Regenerate bitmaps</li>

      <li>Autohint</li>

      <li>Control various metrics settings</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And, of course, you can cut and paste. Normally copying a
    glyph will copy that glyph and any bitmaps associated with it,
    but you can use the Edit-&gt;Copy From menu item to change this
    so that only entries from the currently displayed font are
    copied. So if a 12 pixel font is being displayed then only the
    bitmaps from the 12 pixel bitmap font will be copied in this
    mode. Cut and Clear will clear those things which would be
    copied.</p>

    <p>Paste is a little more complicated. In general it will paste
    whatever is in the clipboard, regardless of the copy mode. So
    if the clipboard contains a 12pixel bitmap and the font view is
    displaying outlines, then pasting it will paste it into the
    12pixel font none the less. There is one exception to this. If
    the clipboard contains a 12 pixel bitmap and the font view is
    currently display a 17pixel bitmap then the paste will go into
    the displayed bitmap.</p>

    <p>A Paste from the font view will delete whatever splines were
    in the glyph beforehand (while a paste in the outline glyph
    view will merge the new set of splines with the old). Paste
    from the font view will also set the width of the glyph.</p>

    <p>You can scroll the display to any particular character by
    typing that character. There is also a dialog which allows a
    slightly more general way of jumping around. You may type in
    the glyph's name (all glyphs in a font will be named), its
    encoding value, its unicode encoding value, or (for 2 byte
    fonts) its ku ten specification.</p>

    <p>Pressing the right mouse button invokes a popup menu.</p>

    <h2><a name="Encodings" id="Encodings">Encodings and Character
    Sets</a></h2>

    <p>A Character Set is a set of characters (for example all the
    letters of the alphabet would be one character set). An
    encoding is a function that takes a number (often between 0 and
    255) and maps it to a character. Often these two are used
    synonymously as an encoding generally implies a given character
    set. (strictly speaking a character set is an unordered
    collection with no implied encoding, and some encodings work
    with multiple character sets).</p>

    <p>All fonts in fontforge have both a character set and an
    encoding. The character set is just the set of characters in
    the font. The encoding is the way those characters are ordered
    (or sometimes, the way the first 256 are ordered). The font
    info dialog allows you to chose the encoding (and character
    set) you wish for a font. Often a font will have a few extra
    glyphs that don't fit into the character set specified by the
    encoding, these glyphs will be placed at the end of the font
    and when the font is output (ie. postscript is generated, or a
    bitmap font created) the glyphs will be included in the font
    but they will not be encoded (this can be useful, especially in
    postscript where it is possible to reencode a font at run time.
    Thus a font might have all the glyphs needed both for a
    cyrillic character set and for a latin one, but only one
    character set at a time would be encoded).</p>

    <p>It is possible for an encoding not to be one-to-one. That is
    there may be several characters that might lead to the same
    underlying glyph (the classic example is the non-breaking space
    which often uses the same glyph as the breaking space). When
    FontForge encounters such an encoding it will create a
    character structure for each entry, one of those structures
    will contain the data for drawing the glyph, the other(s) will
    contain a reference to the one real character. All characters
    will have the same name. When FontForge generates a font it
    looks for this case and turns it into a font whose encoding
    vector contains multiple references to a glyph.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to have an encoding where a single
    character can lead to several different glyphs depending on the
    context. In arabic, for example, most characters have at least
    four different glyphs depending on whether the character is
    found initially, medially or finally in a word, or if it
    appears by itself (isolated).</p>

    <p>You may also create a custom encoding. (Generally, only the
    first 256 entries of a Custom encodings will actually be part
    of a font's encoding vector). You may change the name of any
    glyph in the font with the Element-&gt;Char Info command. This
    will force the font to have a custom encoding.</p>

    <p>There are many standard encodings built in to the program.
    There are 14 ISO 8859 encodings, the encoding used by the
    Macintosh for the US and Western Europe, the encoding used by
    MS Windows for the US and Europe (which is a slight extension
    of ISO 8859-1). There are also several 2-byte encodings built
    in. Several of these are subsets of unicode (whose goal is to
    specify every character currently used by humans). There are
    many large CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) two byte encodings.
    You can also add your own encodings with the <a href=
    "encodingmenu.html">Encoding</a> menu. A brief description of
    what's in the encodings also appears <a href=
    "encodingmenu.html">on that page</a>.</p>

    <p>There may be some slight differences between one vendor's
    definition of an encoding and another. I try to follow those
    encodings specified by the Unicode consortium. I notice that
    the Symbol encoding used by Microsoft differs from the Unicode
    one (usually just be substituting synonyms, Omega for Ohm sign
    for instance).</p>

    <p>Adobe did not choose their naming conventions very well for
    Greek letters. They assigned the name "mu" to Micro Sign,
    "Delta" to Increment and "Omega" to Ohm Sign. So the Greek
    alphabet has ugly nameless holes in it.</p>

    <p>CID fonts (see <a href="#CID">below</a>) have no encodings.
    Instead they are designed to be associated with one or several
    cmap files which provide encodings in a general way. cmap files
    are beyond the scope of FontForge. Adobe has defined many which
    are freely <a href=
    "http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/acrrasianfontpack.html">available</a>.</p>

    <p>There is one final encoding called "Glyph Order". This
    encoding is just the glyphs in the order in which they were
    read from the original font.</p>

    <h3><a name="Unicode" id="Unicode">Unicode</a> (ISO 10646)</h3>

    <p>PostScript® assigns a name to every unicode character. Some
    of these names are fairly obvious like "A" for the first letter
    of the latin alphabet, others are more obscure like "afii57664"
    for hebrew alef, while others are just "uni8765" for the
    unicode character at 0x8765.</p>

    <p>PostScript Unicode encoding does not quite mesh with the
    unicode standard. This is probably because PostScript deals in
    glyphs and Unicode deals with characters so PostScript sees no
    distinction between space and nobreak space (and so does not
    encode the latter) while Unicode does.</p>

    <p>According to the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/">unicode
    website</a> the first 256 character positions of unicode and
    ISO 8859-1 (ISO Latin1) are the same. However the PostScript
    encoding of ISOLatin1 is slightly different from that specified
    for unicode. I cannot explain the reasoning behind this.
    FontForge does not use PostScript's ISOLatin1 Encoding vector,
    instead it uses the first 256 code positions of the unicode
    encoding vector (slightly modified by me to conform to Unicode
    conventions rather than PostScript. So I include nobreak space
    and the soft-hyphen).</p>

    <p>FontForge supports two slightly different unicode encodings.
    The first contains only the first 65536 characters of unicode
    (those in the <a href=
    "http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/bmp.html">Basic Multilingual
    Plane</a>, or BMP), while the second can contain as many
    characters as you have memory for. Character definitions are
    still sparse outside of the BMP so at the moment you probably
    want to use just the BMP. Currently there are only definitions
    for plane 0 (BMP, U+0000-U+ffff), Plane 1 (<a href=
    "http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/smp.html">SMP, Secondary
    Multilingual Plane</a>, U+10000-U+1ffff), Plane 2 (<a href=
    "http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/sip.html">SIP, Supplementary
    Ideographic Plane</a>, U+20000-U+2ffff), and Plane 14 (<a href=
    "http://www.unicode.org/roadmaps/ssp.html">SSP Supplementary
    Special-purpose Plane</a>, U+e0000-U+effff).</p>

    <h2><a name="CID" id="CID">CID keyed fonts</a></h2>

    <p>The standard mechanisms that postscript provides work
    reasonably well for alphabets and syllabaries, but the massive
    number of characters needed for CJK (Chinese, Japanese or
    Korean) fonts require more complex machinations. Adobe's
    current solution is the <a href="cidmenu.html#CID">CID-keyed
    font</a>, a font consisting of several subfonts each a
    collection of glyph descriptions with no encoding imposed on
    them and no names given to them.</p>

    <p>If FontForge loads in a CID keyed font it will enable a
    special menu called <a href="cidmenu.html">CID</a> which (among
    other things) displays the list of all the sub-fonts in the
    font. When it starts up FontForge will pick (practically at
    random) a sub-font to display in the font view. You may change
    which font is displayed by the CID menu.</p>

    <p>The CID menu also allows you to turn a normal font into a
    CID keyed font. It creates a collection containing just the
    original font (you may add other fonts, or blank fonts, later).
    But before it can create a collection FontForge needs to know
    what glyph set you will be using. A glyph set is just a
    collection of glyphs, and you may define your own if you wish
    (but if you do you have to define your own cmap files, etc and
    it's probably not worth it). Adobe has defined glyph sets for
    Japanese (actually there are two, one corresponding to JIS208
    and one to JIS212), Korean (Wansung &amp; Johab), Traditional
    Chinese (Big5) and Simplified Chinese (GB2312). Although these
    glyph sets are based on the standards mentioned, they each have
    many additional glyphs. Adobe also defines a glyph set that
    works for Unicode, but it is called "Identity" instead.
    FontForge does not have these glyph sets built in to it, each
    must be loaded the first time it is used. I provide one file
    for each of the above glyph sets, they have an extension of
    ".cidmap", and you may download them all <a href=
    "cidmaps.tgz">from here</a>.</p>

    <p>(There are also many other character sets floating around
    feel free to install them yourself).</p>

    <p>Adobe identifies each glyph set by a three values: a
    registry, an ordering and a supplement. The registry is the
    name of the organization that is defining the glyph set (Adobe
    calls itself Adobe), an ordering identifies the glyph set
    (Japan1, Korea1, etc.) and the supplement indicates how many
    times the ordering has been revised. Glyphs may only be added
    to an ordering, never removed, so an old font will be perfectly
    described by a newer glyph set, while a new font described by
    an old glyph set will have some unavailable glyphs. So a full
    cidmap name will look like:<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Adobe-Japan1-4.cidmap<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    Adobe-Korea1-2.cidmap</p>

    <p><span class="c3"><strong><big>Warning:</big></strong></span>
    CID keyed fonts (actually any CJK font) use massive amounts of
    memory in FontForge. I am able to work on many of them on my
    256M machine with 384M of swap space.</p>

    <p>The <a href="editmenu.html#Remove-Undoes">Remove Undoes</a>
    command will allow you to free up memory if you think you may
    be running short. FontForge is not always able to protect
    itself against running out of memory, sometimes the OS just
    sends it a SIGKILL signal.</p>

    <h2><a name="MM" id="MM">Multiple Master Fonts</a></h2>

    <p>If the font is a <a href="multiplemaster.html#MM">Multiple
    Master</a> Font there will again be several subfonts only this
    time all the subfonts contain the same glyph set. Each subfont
    provides glyphs for one style of the font family. The <a href=
    "mmmenu.html">MM</a> menu allows you to control which style of
    the family is visible in the font view, and provides a few
    other commands for manipulating multiple masters.</p>

    <h2><a name="Vertical-Metrics" id="Vertical-Metrics">Vertical
    Metrics</a></h2>

    <p>CJK fonts generally should have vertical metrics. Latin
    (Cyrillic, Greek) fonts generally should not. If FontForge
    reads in a font with vertical metrics it will retain those
    metrics, but when FontForge creates a new font then that font
    will not have vertical metrics enabled.</p>

    <p>To enable vertical metrics for a font go to <code><a href=
    "fontinfo.html#vertical">Element-&gt;Font Info</a></code> and
    select the <code>General</code> tab and check the <code>[*] Has
    Vertical Metrics</code> checkbox. This will allow you to set
    the vertical origin for the font and it will give every glyph a
    default vertical advance of the emsize of the font
    (ascent+descent).</p>

    <p>The vertical origin is the y height (in the design
    coordinate system) of the origin for vertical metrics.</p>

    <p>In the outline glyph view you will be able to adjust the
    vertical metrics just as you adjust the horizontal metrics.</p>

    <p>You can view the vertical metrics in the font view just as
    you can the horizontal metrics with View-&gt;Show V
    Metrics.</p>
