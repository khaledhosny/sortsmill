    <p><img src="bdfinfo.png" width="446" height="476" alt=
    "BDF Info dialog" align="right" />If your font contains bitmaps
    you may want control over the BDF Properties associated with
    those bitmaps. Each pixel size (bitmap strike) has its own set
    of properties.</p>

    <p>The X11 consortium has defined certain conventional
    properties and defines their meaning in the <a href=
    "http://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/4.5.0/doc/xlfd.txt">X Long
    Font Descriptor</a> specification.</p>

    <p>When you first create a bitmap strike (with <a href=
    "elementmenu.html#Bitmaps">Element-&gt;Bitmaps Available</a>)
    it will have no properties associated with it. If you then
    generate a bdf file based on that FontForge will give you some
    default properties.</p>

    <p>You may view these default properties in this dialog by
    pressing the <code>[Default All]</code> button -- this will
    remove any current properties (except for <code><a href=
    "#res-y">RESOLUTION_Y</a></code>) and replace them with the
    defaults that FontForge calculates).</p>

    <p>You may select any property and press the <code>[Default
    This]</code> button to find its default value (There are some
    properties that FontForge cannot default, you'll have to figure
    these out yourself).</p>

    <p>You may use the <code>[Delete]</code> button to remove a
    property.</p>

    <p>You may use the up and down arrows buttons to move the
    selected property up or down in the list (as far as I know,
    there is no functional reason for doing this, but if your
    esthetics prefer a different ordering you may enforce it).</p>

    <p>To change a property name depress the mouse on it. You
    should get a list of all standard properties. At the bottom of
    the property list is a special line labeled "New...", clicking
    on it brings up the same popup menu and allows you to create a
    new property.</p>

    <p>To change the value of a property, click in the value field
    and type in the new version.</p>

    <p>To select a property without bringing up the popup menu or
    the editing field, click on the extreme left of the
    property.</p>

    <p>The one essential <a name="res-y" id="res-y">property</a>
    that FontForge can't always guess correctly is the resolution
    (in particular <code>RESOLUTION_Y</code>). When you press
    <code>[Default All]</code> FontForge will retain the current
    value of this property and base the others on it.</p>
