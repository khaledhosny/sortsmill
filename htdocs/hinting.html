    <h1 class="c1">Hinting</h1>

    <p>PostScript originally required that hints should not
    overlap. Now it requires that any active set of hints be
    non-overlapping, but it allows you to change sets as you move
    through the glyph.</p>

    <p>So to implement hinting with hint substitution FontForge
    needs to know not only the position and width of the stem being
    hinted, but also where the stem should be active. And it needs
    to know what stems overlap which other stems.</p>

    <p><img src="Hints.png" width="406" height="399" align=
    "left" /> The horizontal stems are drawn in light green. The
    vertical stems are drawn in light blue. The areas where the
    stems are active are filled in as rectangles, outside of that
    area the stems' outlines are drawn with dotted lines. Most of
    these stems do not conflict with any other stems, but two, the
    bottom two horizontal stems conflict with each other. All the
    non-overlapping stem hints may be active at the same time, but
    only one of the two conflicting stem hints may be active. As
    FontForge outputs the glyph it decides at each point what stems
    need to be active, and activates them.</p>

    <p>PostScript now allows FontForge to control relative counter
    sizes. Counters are the spaces between adjacent stems. In the
    example at left there are two counters of equal sizes between
    the horizontal stems on the left, and three counters of equal
    sizes on the right. These form two independent counter groups,
    and FontForge's Hints-&gt;Auto Counter command will generate a
    counter description for each of them. You may also control the
    counters directly by using the Counters pane of the
    Element-&gt;Char Info dialog.</p>

    <p>Counters spaces appear between vertical stems too, and in
    this case FontForge would output one counter group for the
    vertical stems.</p>

    <h2 clear="all">Serifs</h2>

    <p><img src="serif.png" width="248" height="227" align=
    "right" />One of the major advantages of hint substitution is
    that it allows certain standard serif situations to be
    described. In the example at right, the serif one the left is
    smaller than the stem a bit further right.</p>

    <p><img src="serif2.png" width="158" height="110" align=
    "left" />But it doesn't solve all problems (or I don't know how
    to use it to do so). Consider the serif on the right. Hint
    substitution would allow us to define a hint for the main
    vertical stem and for the short vertical stem that corresponds
    to the serif. But the problem that needs to be solved is making
    the distance between the left edge of the serif and the left
    edge of the stem be the same as the distance between the right
    edge of the stem and the right edge of the serif. But doing so
    would require overlapping hints, active at the same time.
    <small>I think</small></p>

    <h2>Automatic Hinting</h2>

    <p>FontForge's AutoHint command can be used to figure out
    horizontal and vertical stem hints. It will also find hint
    substitution points (if any are needed), and will check for the
    simple counter description allowed by OpenType for non-Asian
    fonts (the equivalent of h/vstem3 hints in type1 fonts).</p>

    <p>Whenever you change a glyph FontForge keeps track of that
    fact that the hints are out of date (when you autohint a glyph,
    or make a manual change to the hints FontForge resets this
    flag). If you generate a postscript font from something that
    contains glyphs with out of date hints, then FontForge will
    automagically regenerate them.</p>

    <p>This may not always be appropriate. You can turn this off in
    general with the <a href="prefs.html#AutoHint">AutoHint
    preference item</a>. You may turn it off for an individual
    glyph with the Hints-&gt;Don't AutoHint command.</p>

    <h2>Manual Hinting</h2>

    <p>I hope that the FontForge's autohint command will be good
    enough that manual efforts will not be needed. But hopes like
    this are rarely fulfilled.</p>

    <p>The AutoHint command should find all stems in a glyph. Some
    of them it deems to be useless and will remove them. If you
    find that FontForge is removing a hint that you think is
    important then invoke Hint-&gt;AutoHint with the shift key held
    down, this will tell FontForge not to prune any of the stems.
    You may then use Review Hints to prune things yourself.</p>

    <p>If you find that you must create your own hints, FontForge
    will only allow you to specify the position and width of the
    hint, it will then go off and try to guess the extents where
    the hint should be active.</p>

    <p>You may manually:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Clear all horizontal stem hints</li>

      <li>Clear all vertical stem hints</li>

      <li>Select two points and create a vertical stem hint that
      whose width is horizontal distance between the two
      points</li>

      <li>Select two points and create a horizontal stem hint whose
      width is the vertical distance between the two points</li>

      <li>Create a horizontal hint starting at an arbitrary y
      location with an arbitrary vertical width.</li>

      <li>Create a vertical hint starting at an arbitrary x
      location with an arbitrary horizontal width.</li>

      <li>Review all your hints, manually changing or removing any
      (or all).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Once you have made a manual change to a glyph's hints with
    any of the above commands, that glyph will be marked "Don't
    AutoHint" until you explicitly call the AutoHint command on it.
    You may also explicitly use the Hints-&gt;Don't AutoHint
    command to turn off FontForge's automatic hinting attempts.</p>

    <p>You may also manually</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Set hint change-over points</li>

      <li>Set counter groups for a glyph</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These do not set the "Don't AutoHint" bit.</p>

    <h3>Manual Hint Substitution Points</h3>

    <p>FontForge's Hints-&gt;Hint Substitution Pts command will
    automatically figure out where hint substitution should occur,
    but if this isn't good enough you may do it manually with the
    <a href="getinfo.html#HintMask">Element-&gt;Get Info</a>
    command (when the selection is a single point to which you want
    to attach a hintmask).</p>

    <p>If a glyph has conflicting hints then the first point in the
    glyph (the first point on the first contour) MUST have a
    hintmask attached to it. If it does not, the FontForge will
    automatically figure substitution points when it generates the
    font. Other points are not required (but may) have a
    hintmask.</p>

    <p>The hintmask specifies what hints should be active when that
    point is positioned, and will control all subsequent points
    until a new hintmask is established. So in the
    following<img src="charwithhintmask.png" width="309" height=
    "322" align="left" /><img src="hintmaskinfo.png" width="321"
    height="459" align="right" /> example, the selected point (on
    left) has the highlit hints active at it, In the glyph view the
    currently active stems are drawn much darker than the inactive
    ones. Points with hintmasks attached to them have circles drawn
    around them.</p>

    <p>Remember to hold the control key down when making disjoint
    selections.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h3>Manual <a name="Counter">Counter</a> Groups</h3>

    <p>FontForge also has a Hints-&gt;Auto Counter command which
    tries to figure out what stems form a counter group.</p>

    <p>Again you can do this manually, with the <a href=
    "charinfo.html#CounterMasks">Counter</a> pane of the
    Element-&gt;Char Info dialog. When creating a new counter group
    you are presented with a dialog very similar to the one above
    in which you must select a set of hints that bound a set of
    counters.</p>

    <h3>The Private dictionary</h3>

    <p>This contains font-wide hinting infomation. Things like: The
    standard width of a stem in the font (StdVW, StdHW), The
    standard height of capitals and lower case letters (BlueValues,
    OtherBlues), and so forth. These live in the PostScript Private
    dictionary. Once you have hinted your font fontforge can
    generate reasonable values for these settings (But you must
    have hinted the font first!) -- See the [Guess] button in the
    <a href="fontinfo.html#Private">Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;PS
    Private</a> dialog. Then once you have generated BlueValues you
    should rehint the font (the hints depend on the BlueValues,
    just as the BlueValues depend on the hints:-).</p>

    <h2>Hints and previously existing fonts.</h2>

    <p>FontForge will not be able to convert TrueType instructions
    into PostScript hints when it reads a TrueType font (the format
    is too complex, there are too many possibilities, instead
    FontForge stores all the truetype instructions and writes them
    back out uninterpretted).</p>

    <p>From a Type1 font it will happily read all the hints in a
    glyph, and keep track of hint substitution points. It will not
    read counter hints though.</p>

    <p>In an OpenType (Type2) font FontForge will read in all the
    hints, keep track of hint substitution points and the counter
    hints.</p>

    <h2>Hinting and TrueType</h2>

    <p>FontForge can auto-instruct a truetype font
    (Hints-&gt;AutoInstr). FontForge also allows you the somewhat
    arcane practice of editing glyph instruction programs directly
    (Hints-&gt;Edit Instructions).</p>

    <p>FontForge's Auto Instructor bases its output on the
    PostScript Stem Hints, the contents of the Private dictionary,
    and diagonal stems. You can create diagonal stems manually
    (Hints-&gt;Add DHint), or you can let the autohinter do this
    for you
    (File-&gt;Preferences-&gt;PSHints-&gt;DetectDiagonalStems).</p>

    <p>Please look at the <a href="ttfinstrs.html">page on
    instructing fonts</a>.</p>

    <h2>Hint questions:</h2>

    <p>I find the hint documentation inadequate for me to do a good
    job at hinting.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Section 2.4 of <a href=
      "http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/5015.Type1_Supp.pdf">
      T1_Supp.pdf</a> says that vertical counters are offset from
      the lbearing, but the example 2.6 shows them being offset
      from 0.</li>

      <li>In <a href=
      "http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/5177.Type2.pdf">
      Type2</a> is it ok to use Counter mask if LanguageGroup is
      not 1 and the stems don't fit into a *stem3 pattern? Or can
      cntrmask only be used for *stem3 in latin letters?</li>

      <li><img src="NoPointHint.png" width="194" height="232"
      align="right" />How do hints work? Is a hint meaningful if
      there are no points associated with it? As in the "O" at
      right, where the two vertical stems have no points associated
      with them.</li>

      <li>Is it meaningful for a hint to have points only on one
      side of it? Can reasonable hints be written for the serif cap
      above left?</li>
    </ul>
