    <h3>Before starting fontforge on <a name="cygwin" id=
    "cygwin">cygwin</a></h3>

    <p>Before you can start fontforge on cygwin you must start the
    X11 server.</p>

    <p>On recent versions of cygwin this may be done by
    invoking</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
C:\cygwin\usr\X11R6\bin\startxwin.bat
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>On older systems:</p>

    <blockquote>
      Open a cygwin window and type

      <blockquote>
        <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>xinit
</pre>
      </blockquote>

      <p>This should create a task window that covers your entire
      screen, inside of which there should be an xterm (sort of
      like the cygwin window earlier). Be prepared to type commands
      in this window.</p>

      <p>You should then type</p>

      <blockquote>
        <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>twm &amp;
</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Notes on the <a name="PATH" id="PATH">PATH</a>
    variable</h3>

    <p>On most systems fontforge will install itself into
    <kbd>/usr/local/bin</kbd> (that's the standard place for
    optional software), and this is not always in the default
    search path for commands (grrrr). Which means you might have
    everything properly installed, but nothing actually works. If
    you see messages like <kbd>"fontforge: command not
    found."</kbd> this has (probably) happened to you.</p>

    <p>So what do you do?</p>

    <p>You need to set the PATH environment variable so that it
    includes /usr/local/bin. The value of the PATH variable is a
    set of directories separated by colons.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>echo $PATH
/home/gww/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/sbin
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Unfortunately there are four ways of doing this because
    there are two different conventions used by unix shells and
    then the mac doesn't behave normally requiring another two
    conventions. Type:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>If the name of your shell is <kbd>bash</kbd> (as above),
    <kbd>ksh</kbd> or <kbd>sh</kbd> then you want to type</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH ; export PATH
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>If the name of your shell is <kbd>tcsh</kbd> or
    <kbd>csh</kbd> then you say</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>setenv PATH /usr/local/bin:$PATH
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>But you'd have to do that every time you logged in. Instead
    you want this included in the shell's initialization. Again
    there are two cases, for the <kbd>bash</kbd> family of shells
    you want to edit the file <kbd>~/.bashrc</kbd> (or
    <kbd>~/.profile</kbd>) while for the <kbd>csh</kbd> family you
    want to edit the file <kbd>~/.cshrc</kbd> (or
    <kbd>~/.login</kbd>). On a bash system the following command is
    generally sufficient:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>cat &gt;&gt;~/.bashrc
PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH ; export PATH
^D
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>(where <kbd>^D</kbd> represents control-D, obtained by
    holding down the control key while depressing
    <kbd>d</kbd>.<br />
    And for the csh family you would type:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>cat &gt;&gt;~/.cshrc
setenv PATH /usr/local/bin:$PATH
^D
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>On non-mac systems it is better to use
    <code>~/.profile</code> and <code>~/.login</code> rather than
    the files given above.</p>

    <h3><a name="Starting" id="Starting">Starting</a> fontforge
    from the command line</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<span class=
"c2">$ </span>fontforge font.pfa font2.sfd font3.ttf font4.otf 
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>will start fontforge looking at the fonts you specify on the
    command line. It can read either pfb or pfa fonts, and some ps
    fonts (type 0 fonts based on a type 1 dictionary) as well as
    truetype fonts, open type fonts and many other formats.</p>

    <p><small>(If you get a message from your computer saying:
    "<kbd>fontforge: Command not found</kbd>" you should read the
    <a href="running.html#PATH">previous section</a>)</small></p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>fontforge -new
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>will cause fontforge to create a new font (in iso-8859-1
    encoding)</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>fontforge
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>will open up a file picker dialog and allow you to browse
    till you've found a font file (or have created a new one).</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>fontforge -script script.pe fonts...
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This will invoke fontforge in a non-interactive mode, and
    have it run the named script. Any further arguments on the
    command line will be passed as arguments to the script and
    processed (or not) by it.</p>

    <p>For a complete description of possible arguments see
    <a href="cliargs.html">the section on the command line</a>.</p>

    <h3><a name="cygwin-troubles" id=
    "cygwin-troubles">Troubleshooting</a> on cygwin</h3>

    <p>One very common problem on cygwin is that you will type in
    the command line to start fontforge -- and absolutely nothing
    will happen. The cygwin shell simply prints another prompt.
    There is no error message. No window appears. Nothing.</p>

    <p>This generally means that you are missing a required
    library. Make sure that the following are installed</p>

    <ul>
      <li>libiconv</li>

      <li>libintl</li>

      <li>libjpeg</li>

      <li>libpng</li>

      <li>libxml2</li>

      <li>libz</li>
    </ul>

    <p>(I have no idea why you don't get an error message. That's a
    bug in cygwin or windows or something. FontForge never gets
    control and has no chance to generate a message itself).</p>

    <h3>On the <a name="mac" id="mac">mac</a></h3>

    <p>FontForge now installs itself as a mac application in the
    Applications folder. You can start FontForge the way you start
    any other application, double clicking on it, dragging files to
    it, etc.</p>

    <p><span class="c3"><strong>Caveat:</strong></span>
    <code>FontForge</code> and <code>Font Book</code> may fight
    over which will open standard fonts if you double click on the
    font file. Both claim they can open these files, neither claims
    to be the prefered application for them. If an .otf file shows
    a fontforge icon (<img src="FFmacotfIcon.png" width="22"
    height="30" align="middle" />) it will be opened by fontforge,
    if a font book icon it will be opened by font book. Dragging a
    font file to the desired application will always work. Or you
    can select the font, and invoke <code>File-&gt;Get Info</code>
    (in the Finder's menu) and use the "Open with" control to
    select an application.</p>

    <p>On the mac the Option key is used to invoke the
    functionality that fontforge's docs call "Alt" or "Meta". (See
    the section on <a href="mac-install.html#Configuring-X11">X11
    configuration</a> for notes on three button mice and the
    command key).</p>
    <hr />

    <p>You can also start fontforge using traditional unix
    methods</p>

    <p>Before you start fontforge on the mac you must start the X11
    server. You can do this by opening the Applications folder, and
    then opening the Utilities folder, and then double-clicking on
    "X11". (If you don't have X11 there then refer back to the
    <a href="mac-install.html#Before">instructions for installing
    it</a>)</p>

    <p>Having done that there should be a menubar with a menu
    labeled "Applications". Click on this. There should be a
    "FontForge" entry in it. Selecting FontForge will start
    fontforge and bring up a dialog allowing you to open a font or
    create a new one.</p>

    <p><span class="c3"><strong>Caveat:</strong></span> FontForge
    does not normally show mac resource fonts in this dialog --
    however it can still open one even it it isn't displayed.
    Simply type in the name of the file containing it. (or change
    the Filter field to "All Files").</p>

    <p>If the Applications menu does not contain a "FontForge"
    entry, you can add one yourself:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Select Applications-&gt;Customize Menu</li>

      <li>Then press the (Add) button in the dialog that
      appears</li>

      <li>Double click in the left-most section of the blank line
      which just appeared and then type "FontForge"</li>

      <li>Press the [Tab] key and type
      "/usr/local/bin/fontforge"</li>

      <li>Press the [Tab] key again and type "f"</li>

      <li>Then press (Done)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>(You may also start fontforge from the command line here. Go
    to the Applications menu and select Terminal (or xterm), and
    then type <a href="running.html#Starting">one of the commands
    listed above</a>)</p>

    <p><span class="c3"><strong>Caveat:</strong></span> Normally
    FontForge will never see the command key shortcuts. X11
    intercepts these and uses them itself. If you would like to be
    able to use Command-Q to quit FontForge then</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Make sure the X11 menu bar is visible</li>

      <li>Select the menu item
      <code>X11-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Input</code></li>

      <li>turn off (uncheck) <code>[] Enable keyboard shortcuts
      under X11</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p><span class="c3"><strong>Caveat:</strong></span> FontForge
    was written assuming the availability of a three button mouse.
    Under 10.4 X11 simulates this by creating a virtual three
    button mouse where the middle button is invoked by Option-Mouse
    click and the right button by Command-Mouse click. (You can
    also control this from X11-&gt;Preferences).</p>
