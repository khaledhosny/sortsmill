      <b><small>NOBLEMAN:</small></b> Now this is what I call
      workmanship. There is nothing on earth more exquisite than a
      bonny book, with well-placed columns of rich black writing in
      beautiful borders, and illuminated pictures cunningly inset.
      But nowadays, instead of looking at books, people read them.
      A book might as well be one of those orders for bacon and
      bran that you are scribbling.

    <h2><a name="FontCreate" id="FontCreate">Font creation</a></h2>

    <p>First create a new font with the <code>New</code> command in
    the <code>File</code> menu (or by using the <kbd>-new</kbd>
    argument at startup).</p>

    <p><img src="newfont.png" width="419" height="189" /></p>

    <p>Give the font a name with the <code><a href=
    "fontinfo.html">Font Info</a></code> command from the
    <code>Element</code> menu. You use this same command to set the
    copyright message and change the ascent and descent (the sum of
    these two determines the size of the em square for the font,
    and by convention is 1000 for postscript fonts, a power of two
    (often 2048 or 4096) for truetype fonts and 15,000 for Ikarus
    fonts). <small>(Also if you are planning on making a truetype
    font you might want to check the Quadratic Splines checkbox to
    use the native truetype format. Editing is a little more
    difficult in this mode though)</small></p>

    <p><img src="fontinfo.png" width="614" height="548" /></p>

    <p>You may also wish to use Encoding-&gt;Reencode to change
    what characters are available in your font. FontForge generally
    creates new fonts with an ISO-8859-1, which contains (most of)
    the characters needed for Western Europe (the latin letters,
    some accented letters, digits, and symbols).</p>

    <h2><a name="CharCreate" id="CharCreate">Creating a
    glyph</a></h2>

    <p>Once you have done that you are ready to start editing
    glyphs. Double click on the entry for "C" in the font view
    above. You should now have an empty Outline Glyph window:</p>

    <p><img src="C1.png" width="272" height="283" /></p>

    <p>The outline glyph window contains two palettes snuggled up
    on the left side of the window. The top palette contains a set
    of editing tools, and the bottom palette is for managing
    drawing layers. They can be added, deleted (not all!), shown or
    hidden, for example.</p>

    <p>Cubic layers (C) use third-order Bezier splines, like PS
    fonts. Quadratic ones (Q) use second-degree splines, that are
    harder to edit, but mathematically easier and simpler to
    control, so they are used in TTF fonts.</p>

    <p>The foreground (F) layer contains the outline that will
    become part of the font. The background (B) layer can contain
    images or line drawings that help you draw this particular
    glyph. The guide (#) layer contains lines that are useful on a
    font-wide basis (such as the x-height). Currently all layers
    are empty.</p>

    <p>This window also shows the glyph's internal coordinate
    system with the x and y axes drawn in light grey. A line
    representing the glyph's advance width is drawn in black at the
    right edge of the window. FontForge assigns an advance width of
    one em (in PostScript that will usually be 1000 units) to the
    advance width of a new glyph.</p>

    <p>Let us assume you already have a bitmap image of the glyph
    you are working on. Select the <a name="Import" id=
    "Import">Import</a> command from the File menu and import that
    image. It will be scaled so that it is as high as the
    em-square.</p>

    <p><img src="C2.png" width="272" height="283" /></p>

    <p>Select the background layer as editable from the layers
    palette, move the mouse pointer to one of the edges of the
    image, hold down the shift key, depress and drag the corner
    until the image is a reasonable size, then move the pointer
    onto the dark part of the image, depress the mouse and drag
    until the image is properly positioned.</p>

    <p><img src="C3.png" width="272" height="283" /></p>

    <p>If you have downloaded the <a href=
    "http://sourceforge.net/projects/autotrace/">autotrace
    program</a> you can invoke <code>Element-&gt;AutoTrace</code>
    to generate an outline from the image. But if you have not you
    must add points yourself. Change the active layer to be the
    foreground, and go to the tools palette and select the round
    (or curve) point. Then move the pointer to the edge of the
    image and add a point. I find that it is best to add points at
    places where the curve is horizontal or vertical, at corners,
    or where the curve changes inflection (A change of inflection
    occurs in a curve like "S" where the curve changes from being
    open to the left to being open on the right. If you follow
    these rules hinting will work better.</p>

    <p><img src="C4.png" width="272" height="283" /></p>

    <p>It is best to enter a curve in a clockwise fashion, so the
    next point should be added up at the top of the image on the
    flat section. Because the shape becomes flat here, a curve
    point is not appropriate, rather a tangent point is (this looks
    like a little triangle on the tools palette). A tangent point
    makes a nice transition from curves to straight lines because
    the curve leaves the point with the same slope the line had
    when it entered.</p>

    <p><img src="C5.png" width="272" height="283" /></p>

    <p>At the moment this "curve" doesn't match the image at all,
    don't worry about that we'll fix it later, and anyway it will
    change on its own as we continue. Note that we now have a
    control point attached to the tangent point (the little blue
    x). The next point needs to go where the image changes
    direction abruptly. Neither a curve nor a tangent point is
    appropriate here, instead we must use a corner point (one of
    the little squares on the tools palette).</p>

    <p><img src="C6.png" width="272" height="283" /></p>

    <p>As you see the old curve now follows the image a bit more
    closely. We continue adding points until we are ready to close
    the path.</p>

    <p><img src="C7.png" width="272" height="283" /></p>

    <p>Then we close the path just by adding a new point on top of
    the old start point</p>

    <p><img src="C8.png" width="272" height="283" /></p>

    <p>Now we must make the curve track the image more closely, to
    do this we must adjust the control points (the blue "x"es). To
    make all the control points visible select the pointer tool and
    double-click on the curve and then move the control points
    around until the curve looks right.</p>

    <p><img src="C9.png" width="266" height="279" /></p>

    <p>Finally we set width. Again with the pointer tool, move the
    mouse to the width line on the right edge of the screen,
    depress and drag the line back to a reasonable location.</p>

    <p><img src="C10.png" width="266" height="279" /></p>

    <p>And we are done with this glyph.</p>

    <p>If you are mathematically inclined you may be interested in
    the coordinates that fontforge shows in the upper left of the
    window. Generally you can draw glyphs quite happily without
    bothering about these, but for those who are interested here is
    some basic info:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Each glyph has its own coordinate system.</li>

      <li>The vertical origin is the font's baseline (the line on
      which most latin letters rest)</li>

      <li>The horizontal origin is the place where drawing the
      glyph will commence. In the example above what gets drawn
      initially is empty space, that is fairly common, and that
      empty space (the distance from the origin to the left edge of
      the glyph) is called the left side bearing.</li>

      <li>The units of the coordinate system are determined by the
      em-size of the font. This is the sum of the font's ascent and
      descent. In the example above the font's ascent is 800 and
      descent is 200, and the ascent line (the one just above the
      top of the "C") is 800 units from the baseline, while the
      descent line is 200 units below.</li>

      <li>So a position of 282,408 (as above) means that the cursor
      is 282 units right of the horizontal origin and 408 units
      above the baseline (or roughly halfway between baseline and
      ascent).</li>
    </ul>
