    <h1 class="c1">Groups of Glyphs</h1>

    <p>A group is a collection of glyphs. It may be any collection
    that appeals to you. My expectation is that groups will be used
    to collect glyphs which are visually associated (in some way)
    close together so that they may be examined and changed without
    the visual clutter of the rest of the font. So you might make a
    group that consisted of "b d p q" which often have similar
    shapes, or in a Korean font you might wish to look at all
    sylables with a give cho-sung.</p>

    <p><img src="fontview-grouped.png" width="423" height="152"
    align="left" />FontForge treats groups like baby encodings. In
    the image at left, it is displaying a font showing only the
    glyphs "b d p q". The order the glyphs are mentioned in the
    group is the order in which they will be displayed in the
    fontview -- and, like an encoding the group may be compaced so
    there are no empty holes for missing glyphs (so if the group
    had contained "b d p uniAC00 q" and the font was missing
    uniAC00, the display would be exactly the same) or uncompacted
    with holes.<br clear="left" />
    Glyphs in a group may be specified by glyph name, by unicode
    code point or by a range of unicode values. The examples above
    all used glyph names. A unicode code point looks like "U+XXXX"
    (where XXXX indicates a hex number). Occasionally fonts will
    use this notation to name their glyphs (they should not, but
    some do), that should not be a significant problem because such
    glyphs should have the obvious unicode code points and so will
    still match. A range of unicode code points looks like
    "U+XXXX-U+YYYY" (XXXX &lt; YYYY).</p>

    <p>A groups are heirarchical. A group may either contain a list
    of glyphs, or a list of sub-groups. (If you display (in the
    fontview) a group which contains subgroups you will see all
    glyphs in all sub-groups. A glyph may occur more than once if
    that is desirable. So a group could contain "A A A A" and the
    fontview would show four copies of "A" (I'm not sure why you'd
    want to do that, but you could). As you design your groups you
    can ask fontforge to check so that you do not inadvertently put
    the same glyph in more that one group (or in the same group
    twice).</p>

    <h2><img src="displaygroups.png" align="right" width="282"
    height="228" />Display by Groups</h2>

    <p>The Display by Groups dialog is shown in the screen shot at
    right. The top-level group is called "Groups" it has two
    children, one called "Vowels" which is a terminal group and
    contains the glyph names of the latin vowels, the other called
    "consonants" which itself contains three subgroups.</p>

    <p>Any group with children will have (to the right of its name)
    a square box containing either a "+" or a "-", clicking on this
    box will either expand all the sub-groups of the group, or
    contract them into invisibility (here all are expanded).</p>

    <p>Clicking on a group's name will select it (clicking again
    will deselect it). Here groups "ascenders" and "descenders" are
    selected. If you were to press <code>[OK]</code> then the
    fontview would show the glyphs associated with "b d f h k l t g
    j p q y" in that order.</p>

    <p>Underneath everything is a check box you may use to specify
    whether you want the results compacted or not.<br clear=
    "right" /></p>

    <h2><img src="definegroups.png" width="282" height="469" align=
    "right" />Define Groups</h2>

    <p>This dialog is a bit more complicated than the previous one.
    It again contains the group list at the top of the dialog, but
    here only one group at a time may be selected, and information
    about it is displayed in the bottom part of the dialog and is
    subject to change.</p>

    <p>You can <code>[Delete]</code> the group (this also deletes
    any subgroups). If the group contains no glyphs then you may
    add sub-groups to it. Every group has a name. If the group
    contains no subgroups you may add glyphs to it.</p>

    <p>The <code>[Set]</code> and <code>[Select]</code> buttons
    interact with the selection in the associated fontview.
    <code>[Set]</code> sets the glyph list to the glyphs selected
    in the fontview, while <code>[Select]</code> changes the
    selection to the glyphs specified in the glyph list. Normally
    glyphs are entered into the glyph list by
    <code>&lt;*&gt;Name</code>, but you can change the radio button
    to <code>&lt;*&gt;Unicode</code> and glyphs will be entered as
    U+0067 U+006A U+0070-U+0071 U+0079.</p>

    <p>If you select <code>[*]No glyph duplicates</code> then ff
    will prevent you from entering the same glyph name (or unicode
    code point) twice (ff will allow you to enter "A" and U+0041 --
    because I'm lazy and this is harder to check for and less
    likely to occur). If you set this in a parent group then there
    can be no glyph duplicates among any of its children.<br clear=
