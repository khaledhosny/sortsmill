    <h1 class="c1">Get Info</h1>

    <p>In the Outline View the Get Info command can generate one of
    four different dialogs depending on what is selected. If a
    single thing is selected, and that thing is a point then the
    <a href="getinfo.html#Point">point info</a> dialog is brought
    up, if it is a reference then the <a href=
    "getinfo.html#GetReferenceInfo">reference dialog</a> is brought
    up, if it is a background image then the <a href=
    "getinfo.html#Image">image dialog</a> is brought up. If it is
    an anchor point then the <a href="getinfo.html#Anchors">anchor
    point</a> dialog is brought up.</p>

    <h2><a name="Point" id="Point">Point</a> Info</h2>

    <p><img src="pointinfo.png" width="321" height="578" align=
    "right" /> This shows information about the current point. The
    Base position is where the point itself is.</p>

    <p>The Next CP shows both the location of the next control
    point, and the offset to that point from the base (and whether
    this setting is the default for that point, if this point is
    the last on an open contour then the [] Default button will be
    grey), underneath the offsets it shows the same information in
    a different format -- as a distance from the point itself, and
    the angle to it.</p>

    <p>The Prev CP does the same for the previous control
    point.</p>

    <p>You may change any of these and the change is reflected in
    the outline view. Your changes are constrained by the point
    type (for instance with tangent points, you may not change the
    angle fields as these are fixed).</p>

    <p>FontForge also shows you the curvature of the two splines on
    either side of the point. In a perfect world these will be
    equal for curve points and the join will appear smooth. It also
    shows the difference between the two. The curvature is the
    reciprical of the radius of the circle tangent to the curve (a
    straight line has curvature 0 because it is a circle with
    infinite radius so its reciprical is 0). For most curves in
    letters this radius is fairly large when expressed in em-units
    (and its reciprical is correspondingly small). To make it
    easier to read, FontForge scales it by the em-size of the font
    -- this is equivalent to expressing it in units where 1
    corresponds to an em (rather than 1000 or 2048).</p>

    <p>You may also change whether a point is a curve, corner or
    tangent point (Caution: Changing from a corner point to a curve
    point and back to a corner point is NOT a no op. It may change
    the control points) You may move on to the next or previous
    point on the path, or the next/previous point of the current
    contour. If you cancel then all changes to all points are
    canceled.</p>

    <p>The colors of the labels reflect the colors of the items
    they refer to. The point itself will be drawn in red, the
    previous control point will be drawn in magenta and the next
    control point will be drawn in dull cyan.</p>

    <p><img src="pointinfo-interp.png" width="321" height="405"
    align="right" />When editing truetype interpolated points it is
    more important to view the control points and let the base
    point continue to be interpolated. The &lt;&gt; Normal and
    &lt;&gt;Interpolated radio buttons control which view is
    active.</p>

    <p>Pressing &lt;&gt; Interpolated may move the point to
    position it correctly for interpolation.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h3><img src="hintmaskinfo.png" width="321" height="459" align=
    "right" /><a name="HintMask" id="HintMask">Hint</a> Mask</h3>

    <p><img src="charwithhintmask.png" width="309" height="322"
    align="left" />If you want to control what hints are active at
    a given point (and at all subsequent points until an new
    hintmask is given) you can use the hint mask pane. This
    provides you with a list of all hints in the current glyph, you
    should select the ones which you want active.</p>

    <p>As you select hints, the glyph view will darken those hints
    so you can see what you've selected.</p>

    <p>Points with circles drawn around them have hintmasks.</p>

    <p>According to Adobe's documentation you should never have two
    hints which conflict active at the same time. FontForge will
    warn you if you do this. Unfortunately there are fonts (even
    fonts from Adobe) which do not follow this rule, so I have made
    this a warning rather than an error.</p>

    <p>Remember to hold the control key down when making disjoint
    selections.</p>

    <p>Sadly the direction in which hintmasks apply is backwards
    from what you would expect (the hintmask applies to this point
    an all previous points on the contour, rather than all
    subsequent ones).</p>

    <h4>Active Hints</h4>

    <p>This looks just like the hint mask, except you cannot change
    anything it in. It shows you what hints are currently selected
    at this point. If a point has a hint mask then the two will be
    identical.</p>

    <h2><img src="spiropointinfo.png" align="right" width="325"
    height="228" /><a name="Spiro" id="Spiro">Spiro</a> Point
    Info</h2>

    <p>If you are editing in spiro (clothoid) mode rather than
    Bezier mode, then there are no control points and the get info
    dialog is much simpler. Just the location of the point and the
    point type.</p>

    <p><br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><img src="agetinfo.png" width="226" height="389" align=
    "right" /><a name="Anchors" id="Anchors">Anchor Points</a>
    Info</h2>

    <p>This dialog shows the selected <a href=
    "overview.html#Anchors">anchor point</a> with the anchor class,
    location, type and (for ligatures) the ligature index. You may
    change any of these attributes (as long as your changes are
    reasonable). You may create new points or delete the current
    one. As with normal points above you may step through all the
    anchor points in your glyph.</p>

    <p>In a truetype font you can force the anchor to track a
    contour point in the truetype glyph. This point can then be
    manipulated with truetype instructions to grid fit it properly
    with the current rasterization.</p>

    <p>Anchor points may also be created with the <a href=
    "pointmenu.html#AddAnchor">Point-&gt;Add Anchor</a>
    command.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><img src="rgetinfo.png" width="319" height="480" align=
    "right" /><a name="GetReferenceInfo" id=
    "GetReferenceInfo">Reference</a> Info</h2>

    <p>This dialog shows the name of the selected reference, its
    encoding in the font and its postscript transformation matrix.
    You may alter the transformation matrix if you desire.</p>

    <p>The transformation matrix maps points in the glyph being
    refered to into their location in the current glyph:<br />
    <code>&nbsp; &nbsp; x<sub>current</sub> =
    TM[1,1]*x<sub>ref</sub> + TM[2,1]*y<sub>ref</sub> +
    TM[3,1]<br />
    &nbsp; &nbsp; y<sub>current</sub> = TM[1,2]*y<sub>ref</sub> +
    TM[2,2]*y<sub>ref</sub> + TM[3,2]</code></p>

    <p>The Use My Metrics checkbox is useful in truetype fonts
    where it forces the metrics (width) of a composite glyph (for
    exampe acute a) is the same as the metrics of one of its
    components (for example a). This is especially important in
    fonts containing instructions that might modify a glyph's
    width.</p>

    <p>The Round To Grid checkbox is also used in truetype hints
    and indicates that the translation should be rounded to the
    rasterizer's grid before being applied to the points of the
    reference. This means that the grid-fitting done by the
    reference's instructions will still be useful in the
    composite.</p>

    <p>In a truetype font a reference may be positioned by matching
    two points, one in the base character, and one in the reference
    itself. In the example at right, the reference to "acute" will
    be moved until point 12 in "acute" is at the same place as
    point 33 in the base glyph. The glory of this method is that
    the truetype instructions assocated with the glyphs can move
    these points around to an appropriate location for the current
    pixelsize.</p>

    <p>Points in a composite glyph are numbered by counting the
    points of the first component, adding 4 (for the 4 phantom
    (metric) points), then counting the points in the second
    composite, adding 4, etc. The first composite is the one which
    is drawn first, not the one which is added first. The Base
    numbering scheme is from the full composite, while the
    reference point is numbered by the current reference. The
    current reference must be drawn after the base point. You may
    use <a href="elementmenu.html#Order">Element-&gt;Order</a> to
    reorder the references.</p>

    <p>(You should probably not set Round To Grid when doing point
    matching)</p>

    <p>The bounding box information is informative only and
    displays the current location and size of the reference.</p>

    <p>The [Show] button will open a glyph outline view showing the
    glyph being referred to.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><a name="Image" id="Image">Image</a> Info</h2>

    <p>This dialog gives the offset to the lower left corner of the
    image and the scale factors applied to the image. Currently you
    may not alter anything here, it is purely informational.</p>
