      "ResourceFile">ResourceFile</a></dt>

      <dd>FontForge will read <a href="xres.html">X Resources</a>
      from a property on the screen. But sometimes this isn't
      enough. You set this preference item to specify a file from
      which these resources should be read (those on the screen
      will also be read and will supersede those in the file).</dd>

      <dt><a name="HelpDir" id="HelpDir">HelpDir</a></dt>

      <dd>FontForge will search this directory for help files when
      the user presses [F1].</dd>

      <dt><a name="OtherSubrsFile" id=
      "OtherSubrsFile">OtherSubrsFile</a></dt>

      <dd>Allows you to redefine the OtherSubrs routines used in
      type1 fonts. The file format is described at the scripting
      command <a href=
      "scripting-alpha.html#ReadOtherSubrsFile">ReadOtherSubrsFile</a>.</dd>

      <dt><a name="FreeTypeInFontView" id=
      "FreeTypeInFontView">FreeTypeInFontView</a></dt>

      <dd>Normally FontForge will use the freetype library to
      generate glyphs for display in the fontview. This is a bit
      slower, but creates better images than using FontForge's
      built-in rasterizer. This preference item allows you to
      control whether to use freetype or FontForge's own
      rasterizer.</dd>

      <dd>The default encoding used to create new fonts. Normally
      this is ISO 8859-1.</dd>

      <dt><a name="NewEmSize" id="NewEmSize">NewEmSize</a></dt>

      <dd>Specifies the default number of em-units in the
      em-square. For PostScript fonts this should be 1000, for
      truetype fonts it should be a power of two (often 512, 1024
      or 2048 will be used).</dd>

      <dt><a name="NewFontsQuadratic" id=
      "NewFontsQuadratic">NewFontsQuadratic</a></dt>

      <dd>Splines in fonts may be either in quadratic or cubic
      format. TrueType fonts use quadratic splines while PostScript
      (and OpenType) fonts use cubic splines. When FontForge
      generates a font it will convert from whatever format is used
      internally to whatever format is required for the font, so
      there will be no problem if this is set incorrectly, but
      setting it correctly for your font means you get a clearer
      idea of what the outlines will look like.</dd>

      <dt><a name="LoadedFontsAsNew" id=
      "LoadedFontsAsNew">LoadedFontsAsNew</a></dt>

      <dd>When FontForge reads in a font it will generally keep the
      splines in the format they used in the font (that is
      quadratic for truetype fonts and cubic for postscript). If
      you set this flag then all loaded fonts will have the same
      file format as that specified by NewFontsQuadratic
      above.<br clear="all" /></dd>

      <dd>This controls the loading of truetype and opentype fonts.
      If a font contains both an unicode encoding subtable and a
      cjk subtable, then this item allows you to pick which one
      FontForge will choose to decode.</dd>

      <dt>AskUserForCMap</dt>

      <dd>When loading an sfnt (truetype, opentype font file), ask
      the user which cmap encoding s/he would like to use.</dd>

      <dt><a name="PreserveTables" id=
      "PreserveTables">PreserveTables</a></dt>

      <dd>A string containing a list of 4 letter table tags
      separated by commas. When loading an SFNT (ttf/otf) file, any
      table in the font with one of these tags will be preserved
      without interpretation. (Note: If FontForge thinks it
      understands the table it will parse it rather than preserving
      it).</dd>

      <dt>SeekCharacter</dt>

      <dd>A unicode character (or a hex name for a unicode
      character, so either "A" or "U+0041"), fontforge will attempt
      to scroll the display to this character when it opens a
      font.</dd>

      <dt>CompactOnOpen</dt>

      <dd>Whether fontforge should make a font compact when it
      opens one (does not apply to openning an sfd file which
      already knows whether it should be compact or not).<br clear=

      "GlyphAutoGoto">GlyphAutoGoto</a></dt>

      <dd>In the glyph window this controls how ff behaves when the
      user types a normal character. If this is On then when a
      normal character is typed the glyph window will shift to
      display that character, if Off typed characters will trigger
      actions associated with that character as a hotkey or be
      ignored. For example the default action associated with ` as
      a hotkey is to trigger Preview mode while that key is
      pressed.</dd>

      <dt>OpenCharsInNewWindow</dt>

      <dd>Double clicking on a glyph in a <a href=

      opened one.<br clear="all" /></dd>

      <dd>Whether constrained motion in the glyph view should allow
      motion parallel to the italic angle as well as horizontal and
      vertical.</dd>

      <dt><a name="ArrowMoveSize" id=
      "ArrowMoveSize">ArrowMoveSize</a></dt>

      <dd>When holding down the Alt (Meta) key, the arrow keys will
      move faster. This preference item says how much faster.</dd>

      <dt><a name="SnapDistance" id=
      "SnapDistance">SnapDistance</a></dt>

      <dd>The maximum distance at which pointer motion in the glyph
      view will be snapped to an interesting object (ie. a point,
      baseline, width line, etc.). This is measured in pixels.</dd>

      <dt>SnapToInt</dt>

      <dd>When positioning points and control points, the mouse
      will move to the nearest integral value. This is useful in
      editing TrueType (or PostScript if you wish to save space in
      the font file).</dd>

      <dt><a name="JoinSnap" id="JoinSnap">JoinSnap</a></dt>

      <dd>The maximum distance between the endpoints of two splines
      before they will join with the Edit-&gt;Join command. This is
      measured in pixels in the char view and em-units
      elsewhere.</dd>

      <dt><a name="StopAtJoin" id="StopAtJoin">StopAtJoin</a></dt>

      <dd>When dragging points in the outline view, if the end
      point of one open contour is moved onto the end point of
      another open contour then those two contours will join. If
      you leave this Off then further motion will continue to move
      the points, if you set this to On then FontForge will stop
      noticing mouse movements (it pretends that you released the
      mouse button). This is useful if you hand jitters a little on
      the mouse.</dd>

      <dt><a name="CopyMetaData" id=
      "CopyMetaData">CopyMetaData</a></dt>

      <dd>Controls the behavior of Edit-&gt;Copy from the fontview.
      Normally Copy does not copy a glyph's metadata (name,
      encoding, etc.) but if this is set then it will.</dd>

      <dt><a name="UndoDepth" id="UndoDepth">UndoDepth</a></dt>

      <dd>Controls the maximum number of Undoes that may be
      retained in a glyph. (In some rare occasions an Undo will be
      stored even if this depth is 0)</dd>

      <dt><a name="UpdateFlex" id="UpdateFlex">UpdateFlex</a></dt>

      <dd>Figure out what points will be part of flex hints after
      every change to a glyph. Points which are at the center of a
      flex hint will have a green halo drawn around them. The
      criteria for flex hints are given on pages 72-73 of Adobe's
      <a href=
      "http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/PDFS/TN/T1_SPEC.PDF">
      T1_Spec.pdf</a>. This setting can be used to show you when
      those criteria are not met.</dd>

      the width of the base glyph (so if you modify the width of A
      then the width of À will automagically change, if À is built
      as a reference to A and a reference to grave)</dd>

      <dd>Whether you want left side bearings of accented glyphs to

      left, then the accent in À will also be shifted
      left)<br clear="all" /></dd>

      <dt><a name="ClearInstrsBigChanges" id=
      "ClearInstrsBigChanges">Clear Instructions on Big
      Changes</a></dt>

      <dd>
        TrueType instructions refer to points by number. So if you
        do any editing that adds, removes or otherwise changes the
        point numbers then the instructions will be applied to a
        different set of points.

        <p>Sometimes the results are amusing, but almost always
        they are ugly and wrong.</p>

        <p>This is very different from having out of date
        PostScript Hints. There the hints are probably just useless
        (as opposed to being actively bad, as here).</p>

        <p>FontForge will normally delete all instructions to
        prevent this happening. However, if you are prepared to fix
        up the instructions after a set of changes you may prefer
        to have the instructions left. Be careful though!</p>

      <dd>Loading a .mf font is a multi step process, first a
      bitmap font is generated, it is loaded into the background,
      then autotrace is invoked to trace around the backgrounds.
      These background bitmaps can take up a lot of space and you
      may not want them after they have been autotraced. Selecting
      this entry will remove those bitmaps from the font after they
      have been used.</dd>

      <dd>The mf program generates a fair amount of verbiage even
      when it is working correctly. And if it is working correctly
      you don't want to see those words. So normally FontForge
      suppresses messages from mf. But if something goes wrong you
      do want to see mf's output and setting this will allow you to

      <dd>Originally Adobe used the PUA (public use area of
      unicode) to contain glyphs for small caps, lower case
      numerals, etc. They have since changed their minds and no
      longer recommend this usage. FontForge normally recognizes
      names like "a.sc" as being mapped to the appropriate slot in
      Adobe's old view of the PUA. If you don't like this behavior
      turn this item off and "a.sc" will not have a unicode

      <dt>UnicodeGlyphNames</dt>

      <dd>Glyph names are supposed to be composed of ASCII letters
      and numbers (and a few other characters). At least they are
      when they are stored in a font. But when you are building a
      font and if you are not an English speaker, it might be
      useful to have a wider range of letters available for glyph
      names. You should never export these names when you generate
      a font (Use the Force Glyph Names to field of the generate
      dialog). <!--

      The base
"<A HREF="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/tech/type/xuid.jsp">XUID</A>". Should
      uniquely identify the user's organization. If present then every new font
      will be given an XUID generated by appending a random number to the end of
      this string (which should consist of a set of numbers separated by spaces).
      Whenever a postscript font is generated then this last number will be incremented
      by 1.
      <P>
      I have registered with Adobe and they have assigned FontForge (actually PfaEdit)
      an extended unique id base of [1021]. When you first start FontForge, FontForge
      will itself append a couple of random numbers to this to give you your own
      extended unique id. And individual fonts will get a fourth number added to
      that.

    <table border="1" cellpadding="2" width="500">
      <caption>
        PS <a name="Hints" id="Hints">Hints</a>
      </caption>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p class="c3"><img src="hintboundingbox.png" width="119"
          height="107" /></p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p class="c3"><img src="hintdiagonalinter.png" width="87"
          height="72" /></p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p class="c3"><img src="hintdiagonalends.png" width="82"
          height="166" /></p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr valign="top">
        <td>HintBoundingBoxes<br />
        Add hints around the bounding boxes of some glyphs. Adobe
        seems to do this.</td>

        <td>HintDiagonalInter<br />
        Add hints at the intersections of diagonal stems</td>

        <td>HintDiagonalEnds<br />
        Add hints at the ends of diagonal stems.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>More importantly there is also the <a name=
    "DetectDiagonalStems" id=
    "DetectDiagonalStems">DetectDiagonalStems</a> option. Make sure
    this is turned on if you intend to have FontForge <a href=
    "hintsmenu.html#AutoInstr">generate truetype instructions
    automatically</a>.<br clear="all" /></p>

    <p><img src="prefs-ttinstrs.png" width="502" height="360"
    align="right" /> <a name="Instrs" href=
    "hintsmenu.html#AutoInstr" id="Instrs">Truetype
    autoinstructor</a> bases its output on postscript hints, but it
    has also its own options:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>InstructDiagonalStems</dt>

      <dd>Generate instructions for diagonal stem hints. For this
      option to be useful, <a href=
      "#DetectDiagonalStems">DetectDiagonalStems</a> must be
      enabled first. Enabling this will lessen apparent weight
      inconsistencies, perceived at some sizes whenever horizontal
      and vertical stems are controlled, but diagonals are
      not.</dd>

      <dt>InstructSerifs</dt>

      <dd>Try to detect serifs and other elements protruding from
      base stems and generate instructions for them: try to control
      distances between serifs' tips and their base stems.</dd>

      <dt>InstructBallTerminals</dt>

      <dd>Generate instructions for ball terminals. They need
      different handling than other kinds of serifs.</dd>

      <dt>InterpolateStrongPoints</dt>

      <dd>Instructing stems is sometimes not enough. This option
      makes FontForge to interpolate some important points (sharp
      corners, inflections, curve extremes), not affected by other
      instructions, between stem edges. Both parallel and
      perpendicular extremes are controlled. Agressive optimization
      is employed, to still leave as many points as possible to
      IUP, but manual review is nevertheless greatly adviced.</dd>

      <dt>CounterControl</dt>

      <dd>Make sure similar or equal counters remain the same in
      gridfitted outlines. This was inspired by, but works somewhat
      independently from, <a href="charinfo.html#CounterMasks">PS
      Counter Hints</a>. Enabling this option means that proper
      shapes are more important than proper scaling of advance
      widths.</dd>

    <dl>
      <dt><a name="UseNewIndicScripts" id=
      "UseNewIndicScripts">UseNewIndicScripts</a></dt>

      <dd>MS has changed the way it handles indic scripts and has
      created a parallel set of script tags for the new method. Set
      this flag if you want to create a font using the new Indic
      system. <!--
      <DT>
      AddDFLTScript
      <DD>
      Someone from Adobe recommended that almost all features should be active
      in the DFLT script. So setting this flag will mean the ff will output most
      features in the OpenType sub-table for the DFLT script.

    the dialog allows you to define built in scripts that will show
    up in the <a href="filemenu.html#ScriptMenu">script menu</a>.
    Each entry has two things associated with it, the menu name and
    a script file. The menu name will be the name of this entry
    inside the script menu, and the <a href="scripting.html">script
    file</a> will be the filename of the file to be invoked. The
    "..." button allows you to browse for script files, which I
    think have extension .pe (but which can have whatever extension
    you prefer if you don't like my conventions).<br clear=

    <p><img src="prefs-macfeat.png" width="502" height="485" align=
    "right" />The <a name="Mac" id="Mac">Mac</a> Features dialog
    allows you to define a set of default names (in many languages)
    for mac features and settings. These names are placed in the
    'name' table whenever a feature/setting is used in a generated
    'morx' table. (Thus if you have some common ligatures in your
    font, then the "ligature" feature names, and the "common
    ligature" setting names will be added to the 'name' table).</p>

    <p>You may also use this dialog to establish which setting(s)
    should be on by default in a given feature and whether the
    feature only allows one setting to be on at a time (the
    settings are mutually exclusive). All of this data may be
    overridden by the similar dialog in the <a href=
    "fontinfo.html#Mac-Features">Element-&gt;Font Info</a>
    dialog.</p>

    <p><img src="macfeature.png" width="258" height="369" alt=
    "Mac Feature dialog" align="left" />To edit an existing feature
    double click on that feature in the list (at right) this will
    bring up the dialog on the left. Each feature must be assigned
    a unique number. You should indicate whether it has mutually
    exclusive features or not. You should provide names for the
    feature in various languages, and you should provide settings
    for the feature.</p>

    <p>To add a new name press the [New] button under the name list
    and you will be prompted for a language and a name.</p>

    <p>To add a new setting press the [New] button under the
    setting list. The setting dialog contains the numeric value of
    this setting (Apple has decreed that if the feature is not
    mutually exclusive, all settings must be even numbers), whether
    this setting is on by default, and then a list of names for the
    setting in as many languages as you like.<br clear="all" />

    <p><img src="prefs-macmap.png" width="502" height="485" align=
    "right" />The Mac <a name="Mapping" id="Mapping">Mapping</a>
    dialog allows you to define a mapping between OTF
    <code>GSUB</code> feature tags and Apple's <a href=
    "http://developer.apple.com/fonts/TTRefMan/RM06/Chap6morx.html">
    <code>mort/morx</code></a> Feature/Setting codes.</p>

    <p><a href=
    "http://developer.apple.com/fonts/Registry/index.html">Apple's
    published list</a> of features and settings appears out of date
    (in that some features used by current fonts are not found in
    it).</p>

    <p>A four letter OTF feature tag may correspond to a mac
    feature/setting combination. If you wish to create a new
    mapping you must first insure that the mac feature setting you
    desire is present in the feature list (above), and then you may
    add the mappings.</p>

    <p><img src="MacMapping.png" width="337" height="198" align=
    "left" />You must specify a mac feature (which must already be
    defined), a mac setting code and a 4 character opentype
    tag.<br clear="all" /></p>
