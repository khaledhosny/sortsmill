    <h1 class="c1">Multi Layered Editing of Type3 and SVG
    fonts</h1>

    <p>When loading a type3 font (or an svg font organized in a
    similar fashion) FontForge will retain information on each
    stroke and fill command. Each command is placed in a separate
    layer and may be edited in isolation.</p>

    <p>A new font may be converted to a multi-layered font by
    selecting Element-&gt;Font Info-&gt;Layers-&gt;Multi Layered
    Font.</p>

    <h2><img src="charview-multilayer.png" width="348" height="571"
    align="right" />Multi Layered editing in the outline view</h2>

    <p>In the image at left we have a glyph drawn by stroking two
    paths. One layer (containing one of the paths) is currently
    selected and is drawn in full. All its points are editable. The
    other layer is shown as a dashed line.</p>

    <p>The Layer palette looks a little different here. There is no
    hinting information (hints are irrelevant in type3 fonts),
    instead there are two named layers (background and grid) which
    behave pretty much as they <a href="charview.html">normally</a>
    do. They may be made active by clicking on their names. They
    may be made invisible by turning off the check box associated
    with them.</p>

    <p>Under these two are the layers that make up the glyph in the
    font. Each layer is identified by a small picture of what that
    layer looks like when rasterized. Clicking on the layer makes
    it editable.</p>

    <p>The layers are ordered in the list as they will be drawn on
    the screen. The topmost layer is drawn first, the bottommost is
    drawn last. Regions drawn earlier will be overwritten by
    Regions drawn later.</p>

    <p>Double clicking on a layer brings up the <a href=
    "#Layer">Layer Info dialog</a>.</p>

    <p>Clicking with the right button brings up the layer menu
    which contains:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Layer Info...</dt>

      <dd>Brings up the <a href="multilayer.html#Layer">Layer
      Info</a> dialog on the current layer (same as double
      clicking)</dd>

      <dt>New Layer...</dt>

      <dd>Creates a new layer and brings up the <a href=
      "multilayer.html#Layer">Layer Info</a> dialog to describe it.
      (the new layer will appear at the bottom of the layer list
      and will be drawn last)</dd>

      <dt>Del Layer</dt>

      <dd>Deletes the current layer (you may not delete the last
      layer in a glyph)</dd>

      <dt>First</dt>

      <dd>Make the current layer the first one to be drawn.</dd>

      <dt>Earlier</dt>

      <dd>Make the current layer be drawn earlier. (swaps it with
      the layer above it)</dd>

      <dt>Later</dt>

      <dd>Makes the current layer be drawn later. (swaps it with
      the layer below it)</dd>

      <dt>Last</dt>

      <dd>Makes the current layer be drawn last.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Images</h3>

    <p>Images are allowed in Type3 fonts. You can use the <a href=
    "filemenu.html#Import">File-&gt;Import</a> command to load an
    image into any of the foreground layers. If the image is a
    bitmap image and the layer will be filled, then it will be
    output with an imagemask command in PostScript (the bitmap will
    be drawn with the fill color), otherwise (and always in SVG)
    the image will be drawn with the colors specified in the image
    (Transparent images are not supported here).</p>

    <p>FontForge will not skew, flip or rotate images.</p>

    <h3><a name="ClipPath" id="ClipPath">Clipping</a> Path</h3>

    <p>Each layer in a Type 3 font may have its own clipping path.
    A clipping path is a contour (or set of contours) and only
    things inside the clipping path will be drawn.</p>

    <p class="c2"><img src="ClippedA.png" width="240" height=
    "218" /> <img src="ClippedARaster.png" width="148" height=
    "227" /></p>

    <p>The above example shows the letter "A" drawn with a clipping
    path that looks like a star burst (the clipping path is drawn
    in blue). To the right above is the result of rasterizing this
    image. The star is not drawn itself, but only the region of the
    A within the star will be drawn.</p>

    <p>You can change the clipping path with the <code><a href=
    "pointmenu.html#ClipPath">Points-&gt;Make Clip Path</a></code>
    command. The clipping path will be set to any selected
    contour(s) in the image. If no contour is selected then there
    will be no clipping path.</p>

    <h2><img src="layerdlg.png" width="422" height="627" align=
    "right" />The <a name="Layer" id="Layer">Layer</a> Info
    dialog</h2>

    <p>This dialog describes various attributes of the way the
    splines (or images) in the current layer are drawn.</p>

    <p>A layer may be either stroked or filled. Or both. Or neither
    (layers containing only images need not be filled or
    stroked).</p>

    <p>You may either specify a color to be used for stroking or
    filling the splines in the layer, or you may specify that the
    color should be inherited (in conventional fonts the color will
    be inherited so that the font user can specify the font's
    color). If you do want to specify a color, you can press the
    color wheel button to get a color picker dialog, or enter a 6
    hex-digit rgb value "#rrggbb".</p>

    <p>SVG fonts may include an opacity level (postscript type3
    fonts may not). 0 is fully transparent, 1.0 is fully opaque, .5
    is translucent. Again this value may be inherited from the
    environment.</p>

    <p>A stroke has a width (which again may be inherited, but
    probably should not be). Strokes are drawn using a circular
    pen. An elliptical pen may be specified by giving a
    transformation matrix here.</p>

    <p>A line may be dashed. Dash patterns are specified as a list
    of numbers, the first number in the list will draw a line
    segment at most that many em-units, the next number will skip
    that many em-units, the third will be drawn, and so on. After
    then entire list has been used, it will start again at the
    begining. If the list has an odd number of elements, then this
    time through the first entry indicates that many units should
    be skipped. So "10" would mean a line which alternates being
    drawn every 10 units, while "20 10" would draw 20 units, skip
    10, draw 20 and so on.</p>

    <p>A stroke needs to know how to treat the ends of paths
    (<code>Line Cap</code>), and how to join non-tangent
    path-segments (<code>Line Join</code>).</p>

    <p>In an additional level of complexity a contour need not be
    filled (or stroked) with a constant color, you can provide a
    repeating pattern, or a gradual change from one color to
    another (a gradient).</p>

    <h3><img src="GradientDlg.png" width="404" height="799" align=
    "right" />Gradients</h3>

    <p>FontForge supports two kinds of gradients, linear gradients
    and radial gradients. In a linear gradient the color changes
    along a line (as in the example at right, and below)</p>

    <p class="c2"><img src="LinearGradient.png" width="148" height=
    "132" /></p>

    <p>You can specify the color at any point along the gradient
    line (as a percentage of the distance along that line). The
    example at left only specifies a color (white) at the start of
    the line, and a color (grey) at the end, but intermediate
    values could be inserted, and a full range of RGB colors may be
    used.</p>

    <p>A Radial gradient specifies a center point and a final
    radius, the start position (and color) is the center point and
    colors change in concentric circles until the final radius (and
    final color) is attained.</p>

    <p class="c2"><img src="RadialGradient.png" width="149" height=
    "132" /> <img src="RadialGradientDlg.png" width="224" height=
    "177" /><br clear="all" /></p>

    <h3><a name="Patterns" id="Patterns">Patterns</a></h3>

    <p><img src="TilePatternDlg.png" width="390" height="449"
    align="right" />A contour may also be filled or stroked with a
    tiled pattern. That is a pattern is repeatedly layed down until
    it covers the entire area to be filled.</p>

    <p class="c2"><img src="TiledPattern.png" width="212" height=
    "157" /></p>

    <p class="c3">In the example above the tile <img src="Tile.png"
    width="83" height="78" /> has been scaled and replicated. The
    example at right is a bit more complex. Not only is the pattern
    replicated, but after that it is rotated through 45 degrees</p>

    <p class="c2"><img src="TiledPattern45.png" width="213" height=
    "157" /></p>

    <p class="c3">The pattern is defined in another glyph in the
    same font. By default the bounding box of that glyph will be
    used to describe the pattern's extent (You may change change
    that with <a href="charinfo.html#TileSize">Element-&gt;Glyph
    Info-&gt;Tile Size</a>). You may then scale it by specifying
    the Width and Height fields. You may apply other
    transformations as described in the dialog.</p>

    <p>FontForge's rasterization leaves much to be desired. It does
    not support full color (rounding everything to a shade of
    grey), and its stroking algorithm is quite poor (it does not
    rasterize dashes), it does not support the full complexity of
    radial gradients...</p>
