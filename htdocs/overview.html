    <h3>Er... <a name="What" id="What">What</a> is a font
    editor?</h3>

    <p>A font editor is a progam designed to creat and modify
    fonts.</p>

    <p>The most obvious aspect is that it is a drawing program like
    FreeHand, Inkscape or Illustrator which lets you draw the
    outlines of your letters. Unlike other drawing progams it
    expects you to draw many pictures at once (one or more for each
    letter) and collects them into a database.</p>

    <p>It allows you to describe the way these pictures interact
    with each other (if you put one picture after the other then
    they should normally be separated by a certain distance -- the
    font's metrics, or if these two pictures are placed adjacent to
    one another then they turn into a third -- the font's
    ligatures, and so on).</p>

    <p>Finally a font editor will bundle up all the pictures you
    have drawn, and all the metadata about how those pictures fit
    together, and will turn that bundle of stuff into a font that
    your computer can use to display text.</p>

    <h3><a name="intro" id="intro">Introductory</a> concepts:
    Fonts, Splines, Lines, Points, Paths and the em-unit</h3>

    <p>Most simply a font is a collection of glyphs. But computer
    fonts must contain more than this, at the least they must also
    contain information on how to map an input string of bytes into
    an output display of visual glyphs. This mapping is called an
    encoding. Many fonts will also contain rules for how adjacent
    glyphs should be arranged. For instance, in fonts for the latin
    alphabet, there is often a rule saying that if "f" and "i" are
    adjacent then a special glyph, a ligature of "f" and "i" should
    be used instead. Fonts for latin letters generally do not
    require such rules (but can be enhanced by them), fonts for
    other scripts like arabic require them.</p>

    <p>What's the difference between a character and a glyph?</p>

    <p>A character is a concept and a glyph is a reification of
    that concept. The letter "A" is a character, while<img src=
    "As.png" width="220" height="33" /> are all glyphs that
    represent an "A". In latin fonts there is often a single glyph
    for every character and a single character for every glyph, but
    not always -- in renaissance printing there were two glyphs for
    a lower-case s, <img src="short-long-s.png" width="17" height=
    "12" />the short and the long s. Whereas a ligature is an
    example of a glyph that represents two (or more) characters. In
    arabic most of the letters (characters) have at least four
    different glyphs, the appropriate glyph being determined by the
    letters around it. Here are four forms of the arabic character
    "seen" <img src="arabic-seen.png" width="108" height="17"
    align="middle" />.</p>

    <p>What is an outline font? What is a bitmap font?</p>

    <p>Each glyph in a font has a shape and there are various ways
    of describing that shape on a computer. PostScript and truetype
    fonts generally describe the outline of the shape and then
    color in the interior of that outline, this coloring process is
    called rasterizing. On the other hand a bitmap font describes
    each glyph by drawing a picture of that character on a
    rectangular grid of pixels. There is a third type, a stroked
    font, where each stem of the glyph is represented by one line
    down the center of the stem, and the line is later drawn with a
    certain width. Most of the time we will not deal with stroked
    fonts directly (the <a href="elementmenu.html#Expand">Expand
    Stroke</a> command can be used to turn them into outlines), but
    if you wish to edit stroked fonts, see the section on <a href=
    "multilayer.html">multi-layered editing</a>.</p>

    </table>

    <p>An outline is composed of a set of contours or paths. In the
    picture on the above left the letter A is described by three
    different paths. The main one is on the outside and the two
    smaller ones are internal. Each of these paths is composed of a
    series of (BÃ©zier) splines and line segments. FontForge can
    handle cubic and quadratic splines. PostScript fonts use cubic
    splines, TrueType fonts use quadratic (SVG fonts can be
    either).</p>

    <p>Each cubic <a name="spline" id="spline">spline</a> is
    defined by four points, two of which mark the end points of the
    spline and two more to describe the slope of the spline at
    those end points. Here are <a href="bezier.html">two cubic
    splines</a> with all their points shown:</p>

    <p><img src="splines.gif" width="172" height="179" align=
    "left" /></p>

    <p>The points which describe the slope are called control
    points. They are represented here (and in fontforge) by little
    colored x's. Moving a control point will change the shape of
    the spline, but it will not alter where the spline begins or
    ends.</p>

    <p><img src="pnts.gif" width="169" height="165" align=
    "right" />A series of splines and lines are joined together to
    make a path. There are several possible ways to make these
    joins as is shown in the example to the right. In each case we
    have three points in approximately the same relative positions.
    The three points are joined by splines or lines, but the type
    of joins alters the appearance of the connections.</p>

    <p>In the first case there are no control points and the result
    is two straight lines, in the second case there is a line and a
    curved spline which are tangent at their point of intersection,
    in the third case there are two splines which are again tangent
    at their point of intersection. The point of intersection in
    the first case is called a corner point, and the incoming and
    outgoing splines or lines may be in any orientation with
    respect to each other. This is represented in fontforge by a
    square box. In the second case the point of intersection is
    called a tangent point, it is represented by a triangle. The
    third case is a curved point and is represented by a
    circle.</p>

    <p><img src="quadraticspline.gif" width="127" height="92"
    align="left" />FontForge can also edit <a name="quadratic" id=
    "quadratic">quadratic</a> splines (the splines used in truetype
    fonts), here there is only one control point and it controls
    the slopes at both end-points. Because of this quadratic
    splines cannot bend in as many ways as cubic splines (the first
    spline above left would need at least two quadratic splines to
    draw), and you will often need more splines to achieve the same
    curve. You can control whether a font contains cubic or
    quadratic splines with the <a href=
    "fontinfo.html#PS-General">Element-&gt;Font Info</a>
    command.</p>

    <p>There are many different types of splines in the world. The
    ones described above are BÃ©ziers -- these are numerically
    simple and have a number of nice properties -- which is why
    they are used internally in fonts. However, there are some even
    nicer splines. It is easy to give BÃ©zier splines the same slope
    on either side of a point, but a curve will look much nicer if
    it has the same curvature on either side of a point. Clothoid
    splines have this property.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.levien.com/">Raph Levien</a> has kindly
    donated to the open source community a <a href=
    "http://libspiro.sf.net/">library</a> for converting clothoid
    splines into BÃ©ziers.</p>

    <p>Clothoid splines are much easier to work with than BÃ©ziers
    -- there are no control points, just a sequence of on-curve
    points, and magically a beautiful curve will appear between
    them. FontForge can <a href=
    "charview.html#spiro-mode">either</a> edit a curve as a set of
    BÃ©ziers or as a set of clothoids.</p>

    <p>A path is closed when it comes back and joins its start. All
    paths in an outline font should be closed. Once a path is
    closed in may be said to have a direction, essentially this may
    be thought of as "Was the path created in a clockwise or a
    counter-clockwise fashion?" (this is actually a little
    simplistic, if a path intersects itself, as in a figure 8, then
    the direction cannot be described as either clockwise or
    counter-clockwise, but most paths do not self-intersect (and
    paths in a font <strong>SHOULD NOT</strong> self-intersect) and
    we will simplify our life by pretending that we can call paths
    clockwise or counter).</p>

    <p>When time comes to draw our outline glyph we want to make
    dark everything in the interior of the outline. But let's look
    at the outline of our A above. We have two paths inside the
    main outline path, and we want the interior of those two paths
    to be white rather than dark. How do we make this distinction?
    We do it by the direction of the paths. Consider any point in
    the glyph. If we draw an imaginary line from that point out to
    infinity (in any direction) and count the number of times we
    cross a path, each time we cross a clockwise path we add one to
    our count, each time we cross a counter clockwise path we
    subtract one. If the result of our count is non-zero then we
    color the point dark, otherwise we leave it white. So to make
    the A above work we make the outer path be clockwise and the
    two inner ones be counter-clockwise (Things could be done the
    other way around, but the convention is that the outer path
    should be clockwise).</p>

    <p>All of these points (both the end points and the control
    points) are described mathematically. Each point is positioned
    on a cartesian coordinate system which has its origin on the
    glyph's <a href="#Baseline">baseline</a> (the line on which
    letters without descenders rest). Most font formats expect
    coordinates to be integers between -32768 and 32767, FontForge
    uses real numbers internally but (usually) rounds to the
    nearest integer when generating a font file.</p>

    <p>Generally it is a good idea to restrict yourself to integral
    coordinates. TrueType fonts can only contain integral
    coordinates so if you use a non-integral value FontForge will
    be forced to round it to an integer and this will alter the
    shape of the curve. PostScript fonts can contain non-integral
    values, but the various formats are optimized for integers. So
    use integers when you can. If you need more precision you can
    increase the "em-size" of the font.</p>

    <p>When displaying a font we use the word "<a name="em-unit"
    id="em-unit">em</a>" to represent the size of the font. If a
    font is displayed at 12points then 1em will be 12points. If the
    font is displayed at 18points then an em will be 18points.
    (traditionally a 12 point font is one where the metal slugs are
    12 points tall -- or where the baseline to baseline spacing of
    unleaded text is 12 points, so an em was the size of the
    metal.).</p>

    <p>When designing an outline font, you can no longer think in
    terms of points -- these fonts are scalable and can be any
    pointsize. You must think in terms of the em and fractions of
    the em. When you create a font you choose how many internal
    units (called "em-units") to use to represent 1 em -- this
    number is called the "em-size". In most PostScript fonts there
    are 1000 units to the em, TrueType fonts often have either 1024
    or 2048 units to the em (TrueType recommends that you use a
    power of two). But you can choose any (positive) number you
    like (well, as long as it is less than 32767), the numbers
    above are conventions not requirements).</p>

    <p>Suppose you have a dash in a PostScript font, and that dash
    is 500 units long, and the font has 1000 units to the em.
    Suppose a someone displays that dash at 12 points. Then that
    dash will be drawn with a length of 500/1000 * 12 = 6 points.
    On a 72 dot per inch screen where a pixel is almost exactly one
    point, the dash will be 6 pixels long.</p>

    <p><img src="sidebearings.png" width="111" height="191" align=
    "right" />Every glyph has its own coÃ¶rdinate system. The font's
    <a href="#Baseline">baseline</a> (the line upon which most
    latin glyphs will rest) is 0 in the vertical direction. The
    horizontal origin is where the glyph will start being drawn
    (what is "drawn" will usually be empty space for a short while
    -- as there is usually some space between the origin and the
    edge of the glyph). This horizontal distance between the origin
    and the leftmost edge of the glyph is called the left side
    bearing (it may be negative, positive or zero). All glyphs have
    a width (sometimes called an advance width), this is the
    distance from the origin of the current glyph to the origin of
    the next. The distance between the right edge of the glyph and
    the width is called the right side bearing.</p>

    <p>CJK text (Chinese, Japanese or Korean) can be written either
    vertically or horizontally, and so CJK fonts usually have a
    vertical advance width as well as the more common horizontal
    advance (and concomittant top and bottom side bearings).</p>

    <p>A glyph like "g" or "y" extends below the baseline, this is
    called a descender, while a glyph like "k" or "l" extends above
    the x-height, this is called an ascender. Most latin (and greek
    and cyrillic) fonts have certain standard heights: the height
    of a lower case letter (without an ascender) is called the
    x-height, the height of a capital letter is called the
    cap-height, the height of the ascenders is called the ascender
    height (some, but not all, fonts have the ascenders and
    capitals at the same approximate height). Often these will not
    be exactly the same for all glyphs, the letter "O" is usually
    slightly taller than the letter "I", but they both are within
    the range of the cap height for the font.</p>

    <p>The font itself has an ascent and descent associated with
    it. In the old days of metal type nothing could ascend above or
    descend below these values, nowadays accents and ascenders may
    reach above the font-wide ascent and descenders below the
    descent, but the concept is still a convenient one to retain.
    It is true that in almost all cases the glyphs will not ascend
    above or descend below the font-wide ascent and descent. The
    sum of the ascent and descent is the size of the font. The
    point size of a piece of metal type was determined by this
    value (essentially the height of the metal block holding the
    glyph). In a postscript font the local coordinate system is
    independent of the final size at which the font will be
    drawn.</p>

    <h3><a name="PT" id="PT">TrueType</a> vs. PostScript vs
    OpenType vs SVG fonts</h3>

    <p>FontForge can produce many font types. What's the
    difference?</p>

    <p>PostScript is based on a <a href="bezier.html">cubic
    spline</a> technology, while TrueType is based on a <a href=
    "bezier.html">quadratic</a> technology. Cubic splines are
    generally easier to edit (more shapes are possible with them).
    Any quadratic spline can be converted to a cubic spline with
    essentially no loss. A cubic spline can be converted to a
    quadratic with arbitrary precision, but there will be a slight
    loss of accuracy in most cases.</p>

    <p>Within FontForge a font may contain either cubic or
    quadratic splines. These are converted to the appropriate
    format when a font is generated.</p>

    <p>The other major difference between the two is how they solve
    the problem of drawing nice images at small pointsizes.
    PostScript calls this "Hinting", while TrueType calls it
    "Instructing" a font.</p>

    <h4>What's OpenType?</h4>

    <p>Unfortunately the word "OpenType" has come to have several
    meanings.</p>

    <p>The first meaning describes the glyph (and spline) format of
    the font. In this sense Open Type is just a postscript font put
    into a truetype file format -- From the outside it looks like a
    truetype font except that the outline descriptions are
    postscript Type2 font descriptions rather than TrueType.
    Technically it is a <a href="glossary.html#CFF">CFF</a> font
    inside an <a href="glossary.html#SFNT">sfnt</a> wrapper.</p>

    <p>In a second sense of the word OpenType refers to a set of
    tables containing advanced typographic information. These
    tables may be added to either fonts specified with quadratic
    splines (truetype) or fonts with cubic splines.</p>

    <p>Finally MS Windows uses an OpenType icon for a font if that
    font contains a 'DSIG' (Digital Signature) table.</p>

    <p>To make things even more confusing the OpenType
    specification includes the old TrueType specification, so
    technically any TrueType font can be called an OpenType
    font.</p>

    <p>FontForge does not support the DSIG table (if you want one
    there is a free tool from MS which will add one). When
    generating a font, FontForge uses the term "OpenType (CFF)" to
    represent a PostScript (CFF) font inside an sfont wrapper. To
    include OpenType typography tables you would press the
    <code>[Options]</code> button and select the <code>[]
    OpenType</code> check box.</p>

    <h4>What's SVG?</h4>

    <p>SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) provides a relatively new
    font format, written in an xml dialect. SVG fonts can be either
    cubic or quadratic (or can use both, but FontForge is limited
    and will force a font to be either all cubic or all quadratic).
    SVG allows for two different types of fonts, one corresponds
    roughly to PostScript Type1 fonts, and the other, roughly to
    PostScript Type3 fonts.</p>

    <h4>What are Type3 fonts?</h4>

    <p>Back in the early days of PostScript, the Type1 format was
    proprietary, only Adobe could make Type1 fonts, but anyone
    could make Type3 fonts. Type3 fonts were unhinted, but could
    include any postscript command and so could produce a wider
    range of pictures (multi-colored glyphs, stroked glyphs, glyphs
    based on scaled images, etc.). Most of the time these
    extensions are unnecessary, and the disadvantage of being
    unhinted is onerous -- but sometimes you want to play.</p>

    <h4>What are Type1 fonts?</h4>

    <p>These were the standard stand-alone PostScript fonts of the
    '80s and '90s.</p>

    <h4>What are Type2 fonts?</h4>

    <p>These use a slightly different internal format (a more
    compact one) to express the same information as type1. This is
    the format that lives inside a CFF font which lives inside an
    OpenType font.</p>

    <h4>What are CFF fonts?</h4>

    <p>This is the font format that is designed to store PostScript
    Type2 information. It is most commonly found inside an OpenType
    (PostScript) font.</p>

    <h4>What is Apple Advanced Typography?</h4>

    <p>This is another way of specifying typographic information
    (like ligatures, kerning, glyph substitutions). It appeared
    before OpenType and is only used on Apple computers. It is
    based on state machines and is a little harder to work with
    than OpenType.</p>

    <h3><a name="Hints" id="Hints">Hints</a></h3>

    <p>At small pixel sizes, the process of drawing the interior of
    an outline font is quite difficult to do well. PostScript and
    TrueType have different approaches to the problem of providing
    extra information to the rasterizer about how to draw small
    fonts.</p>

      <dd>
        <h4>PostScript</h4>
      </dd>

      <dd>
        Adobe incorporated several different ways of providing
        hints for the rasterizer about how things should be
        treated. The most obvious of these are the horizontal and
        vertical stem hints. Each glyph has its own set of hints to
        tell the rasterizer where to find stems. FontForge can
        usually figure out a reasonable set of stem hints (a
        process called <a href=
        "hintsmenu.html#AutoHint">autohinting</a>), but some glyphs
        are too complex for it and it can make bad choices. It also
        provides a mode for you to override its choices.

        <p>Adobe also has a mechanism for handling dished serifs
        called flex hinting. This means a curve that is only
        slightly deformed from the horizontal (or vertical) will
        display as a line at small point sizes and as a curve at
        larger ones. FontForge will use these when it seems
        appropriate.</p>

        <p>The original version of hints did not allow them to
        overlap, this meant that most serifs could not be
        described, Adobe then developed a mechanism called hint
        substitution which allows for different sets of
        non-overlapping hints to exist in different parts of the
        glyph. There are still shapes which cannot be fully hinted,
        but hint substitution is an improvement. The
        Hints-&gt;AutoHint command will figure out what stems
        overlap and where to change the current set of hints. The
        Hints-&gt;Hint Substitution Pts command will also figure
        where hint changes should occur, and the Hint Mask pane of
        the Point Info dialog gives the user direct control over
        this.</p>

        <p>Most recently Adobe has provide a means to control the
        counters, the spaces between stems, in a glyph. The
        original Type1 description provided support for the
        horizontal counters in "m" and the vertical counters in "E"
        but more complex shapes could not be dealt with. Counter
        Hints (in a type1 font) may only be used with non-latin
        (non-greek, non-cyrillic) glyph sets, in type2 (OpenType)
        things are a bit more complicated,. FontForge will generate
        counter hints when appropriate.</p>

        <p>Adobe provides some font-wide hinting mechanisms. The
        two most obvious are the BlueValues and StemSnap settings
        in the <a href="fontinfo.html#Private">private
        dictionary</a>. BlueValues provides a list of vertical
        zones in which interesting things happen (so in a latin
        font this might include the ascender height, the
        cap-height, the x-height, the baseline and the descender
        height. At small point sizes everything within one of these
        zones will snap to the same height, while at larger point
        sizes the heights will be slightly different (for instance
        an "o" and an "x" usually have slightly different heights,
        but displaying that at a small point size would be ugly).
        Similarly the StemSnap variables specify standard stem
        widths for the font. FontForge will try to guess reasonable
        values for these. It also allows you to override these
        guesses and <a href="fontinfo.html#Private">specify your
        own values</a>. For a more comprehensible description of
        the private dictionary and what it can do, look at <a href=

        <p>On the other hand, True Type says that figuring out what
        pixels to turn on would be a lot simpler if only the points
        and the splines were in the right place (ie. at pixel
        boundaries). And so True Type provides a set of
        instructions that move points around until they are
        positioned appropriately for a given size.</p>

        <p>FontForge's hinting of True Type (properly called
        "instructing") is based on the stem hints also used by
        PostScript and on diagonal hints. It uses these hints to
        determine which points to move and where to move them.</p>

        <p>When FontForge reads in a TrueType font it will store
        the instructions used, and when it next generates that font
        it will use those instructions -- provided no significant
        change has happened to a glyph.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Most of my <a href="hinting.html">hinting user interface</a>
    is designed with PostScript fonts in mind.</p>

    <h3><a name="References" id="References">References</a></h3>

    <p>In addition to a set of outlines (splines) glyphs may be
    built out of references to other glyphs. This is especially
    handy for the accented glyphs, "Ã " can be made up of a
    reference to the "a" glyph and another reference to the "`"
    glyph. This can result in significant space savings, and in
    ease of design (if you change the "a" glyph after making a
    reference to it the "Ã " glyph will automatically change too,
    whereas if you just copied the "a" you would have to recopy
    it.</p>

    <p>FontForge has three commands for manipulating references,
    and one higher level command for building accented glyphs. The
    <code><a href="editmenu.html#Reference">Edit-&gt;Copy
    Reference</a></code> command will put a reference to the
    current glyph into the clipboard, which a subsequent
    <code><a href="editmenu.html#Paste">Edit-&gt;Paste</a></code>
    command will install as a reference. The <code><a href=
    "editmenu.html#Unlink">Edit-&gt;Unlink Reference</a></code>
    command will turn a reference in a glyph into it's component
    splines. The <code><a href=
    "elementmenu.html#Info">Element-&gt;Get Info</a></code> command
    (when applied to a reference) will bring up a dialog showing
    you what glyph is referred to, and allowing you to bring up an
    editing window on that glyph. Finally the <code><a href=
    "elementmenu.html#Accented">Element-&gt;Build-&gt;Accented
    Glyphs</a></code> command will figure out what glyphs should be
    refered to to build this composite glyph, and then will make
    those references and position them appropriately. So if "Ã "
    were selected and you did a <a href=
    "elementmenu.html#Accented"><code>Element-&gt;Build-&gt;Accented
    Glyphs</code></a> command, FontForge would make a reference to
    "a" and another to "`", and place the accent above the letter,
    and centered on it.</p>

    <p>Some bitmap formats (OK, only one that I'm aware of) support
    references, so FontForge allows references in bitmap glyphs as
    well as in outline glyphs.</p>

    <p>Sadly life is not always that simple. The references
    FontForge uses internally cannot always be converted into
    something equivalent in the output font. Generally this causes
    no problems (FontForge will simply unlink the reference in the
    output, which just makes the font a little bigger, but it has
    implications for instructing TrueType, and, to a lesser extent,
    hinting PostScript. Most people can ignore this, but if you are
    interested <a href="ref-caveats.html">follow this
    link</a>).</p>

    <p>Most font formats require that a glyph contain either a set
    of outlines (or bitmap rasters) or a set of references.
    FontForge allows glyphs with a combination of the two, but, as
    above, when it comes time to output the results, FontForge will
    clean up the glyph (generally by unlinking references) so that
    it can be output in the current format.</p>

    <h3><a name="Layers" id="Layers">Layers</a></h3>

    <p>A font may have several layers. When FontForge creates a new
    font it will have 2 real layers (the foreground and background
    layers) and a sort of half-layer for guidelines which is shared
    by all glyphs. In normal fonts all glyphs have the same number
    of layers (This is not true of Type3 fonts, and <a href=
    "#Type3">I'll talk about them later.</a>)</p>

    <p>Both the foreground layer and the background layer have
    certain predefined meanings: The foreground layer is the
    default layer for dialogs where there is no clear way to
    specify a layer. The background layer can contain all sorts of
    stuff, basically whatever you want it to, but any images in it
    may be autotraced into the foreground layer.</p>

    <p>You may add other layers with the <code><a href=
    "fontinfo.html#Layers">Element-&gt;Font
    Info-&gt;Layers</a></code> pane. Each layer may have a name and
    a different kind of splines (quadratic or cubic).</p>

    <p>One potential use of addtional layers: Many people find it
    easier to edit using cubic splines but like to produce truetype
    fonts with quadratic splines. You can use one layer to hold the
    cubic splines and another to hold the quadratics. There are
    commands for comparing layers (<code><a href=
    "elementmenu.html#CompareL2L">Element-&gt;Compare Layer To
    Layer</a></code>) and others for copying one layer to another
    (and adjusting the splines to fit the new layer: <code><a href=
    "editmenu.html#CopyL2L">Edit-&gt;Copy Layer To
    Layer</a></code>).</p>

    <p>It seems a shame to have both a valid cubic and a valid
    quadratic font in a database and only be able to produce a font
    from one of them, so the font view will allow you to switch
    between layers (<code><a href=
    "viewmenu.html#FVLayers">View-&gt;Layers-&gt;*</a></code>) and
    <code><a href="generate.html">File-&gt;Generate
    Fonts</a></code> command will allow you to output whatever
    layer you want into the font. (Note that all layers will share
    the same hints, instructions, character set, bitmaps, etc. It
    is only the outlines which differ.) Furthermore, you may choose
    to store all the layers of a font into an sfnt (TrueType /
    OpenType font) with the <a href=
    "generate.html#Options"><code>[]Layers</code> checkbox of the
    PfaEdit table of the <code>[Options]</code></a> dialog.</p>

    <h4><a name="Type3" id="Type3">Type3 Fonts</a></h4>

    <p>Most people aren't interested in editing <a href=
    "multilayer.html">Type3 PostScript fonts</a> (nor the
    equivalent SVG font), but if you want to, FontForge can. Here
    each layer represents a different drawing operation, and may
    specify a different color, stroke, fill, etc. Layers are not
    font-wide, each glyph has its own set of layers (which are not
    named). You can <a href="multilayer.html#Layer">create new
    layers with a popup menu</a> in the layers pane of the outline
    view.</p>

    <h4>Guidelines</h4>

    <p>In FontForge guidelines live in their own mini-layer (it
    isn't a full layer because all glyphs share the same set of
    guidelines rather than having an individual layer for each
    glyph). It can be edited just like any other layer and you may
    have guidelines of any shape you desire. You may also drag out
    horizontal and vertical guidelines from the edges of the
    outline glyph view.</p>

    <h3><a name="Scripts" id="Scripts">Scripts</a></h3>

    <p>A script is a collection of letter shapes and rules for
    putting letters together. For instance the latin script
    consists of the letters A-Z, written left to right, along with
    a transformation from upper to lower case, a few ligatures and
    rules for generating accents. Arabic is a script consisting of
    its own character set, written right to left, along with
    transformations for initial, medial, final and isolated forms,
    many ligatures and rules for placing vowel marks.</p>

    <h3><a name="Glyph-names" id="Glyph-names">Glyph names &amp;
    Namelists</a></h3>

    <p>Within fontforge every glyph will have a name. Generally the
    glyph name will be something that provides information about
    what the glyph looks like so the name for the glyph
    representing "9" is "nine". Adobe has established a <a href=
    "http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/opentype/aglfn13.txt">
    standard for what names may be assigned to what glyphs</a>, and
    when producing a font for general use it is best to stick to
    that standard (Acrobat uses the glyph names and recognizes the
    standard ones. If you try and use "neuf" for "nine" Acrobat
    will not recognize it and surprising things will fail).</p>

    <p>Adobe's standard provides reasonably mnemonic names for most
    latin and greek glyphs (to English speakers anyway), some
    rather incomprehensible names for cyrillic and hebrew
    (afiiXXXXX) and identifies most other glyphs by unicode code
    point (uniXXXX or uXXXXX where "X" represents a hex digit and
    XXXX is the unicode code point in hex).</p>

    <p>If you are an english speaker and you are working with latin
    glyphs this is fine and dandy. But if you are French you might
    wish that "adieresis" were named "atrÃ©ma" -- for that matter
    even if you are an English speaker you might prefer it to be
    named "aumlaut". No matter who you are you might prefer more
    mnemonic names for the code block you are working on.</p>

    <p>FontForge has a concept called a <a href=
    "encodingmenu.html#namelist">namelist</a>, each of which is
    simply a mapping from unicode code point to name. Several
    namelists may be defined, different lists may apply to
    different fonts and a font may have all its glyphs renamed from
    one namelist to another.</p>

    <p>Namelists can also help navigating in a font. Even if a list
    does not apply to a given font its names may be used in the
    goto dialog to find glyphs. So if you've loaded a french
    namelist you can search for "atrÃ©ma" and FontForge will show
    you the glyph "adieresis" or "uni00E4" or "aumlaut" or
    whatever.</p>

    <p>A few caveats: Adobe's glyph name standard expects all glyph
    names to be in ASCII characters. Syntactically postscript
    permits a wider range of glyph names, but if you use non-ASCII
    characters some rasterizers might have problems. Best to keep
    non-ASCII names within fontforge (and rename glyphs to adobe's
    standard names before generating a font).</p>

    <h3><a name="Lookups" id="Lookups">Lookups,</a> Features,
    Scripts and Languages</h3>

    <p>OpenType (and Apple Advanced Typography) allow various
    transformations to be applied to the input glyph stream to
    produce an output glyph stream. These transformations might
    include forming ligatures, kerning glyphs closer to each other,
    attaching vowel marks or diacritics to letters, conditionally
    replacing one glyph with another depending on the glyphs around
    it, etc.</p>

    <p>The commands for each transformation are stored in what are
    called lookups. If you were designing a set of lookups to
    handle latin ligatures, you might have one lookup for ff, fl
    and ffl -- ligatures that happen almost all the time, another
    for fi and ffi -- ligatures which don't happen in Turkish but
    do in other languages, and lookups for ct and st -- ligatures
    which rarely happen in English but are more frequent in German
    (I think).</p>

    <p>A Feature is a tagged collection of lookups. The tags are
    all 4 letter sequences (like 'liga') with standardized
    meanings. The 'liga' tag means standard ligatures. The 'dlig'
    tag means discretionary ligatures, and 'kern' means kerning.
    There are many others.</p>

    <p>Every script (latin, cyrillic, han ideographs, ...) will
    have its own set of features that are meaningful to it.
    Sometimes things will be even more complicated, and each
    language within a script will have it's own set of features. In
    the example above we might assign scripts, languages, features
    and lookups thusly:</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="2">
      <tr>
        <th>Script</th>

        <th>Language</th>

        <th>Feature</th>

      </tr>

        <td rowspan="3">default</td>

        <td>lookup for ff, fl and ffl</td>

        <td>Lookups may be shared, so this can be the same lookup
        as above<br />
        (Turkish distinguishes between i and dotlessi and fi
        ligatures hide this distinction.)</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td rowspan="3">German</td>

        <td rowspan="3">liga</td>

      <tr>
        <td>lookup for fi and ffi</td>

        <td></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>lookup for ct and st</td>

        <td>Lookups may even be shared by a different feature type,
        so for English and Spanish ct might count as a
        discretionary ligature, one rarely used, while in German it
        mght be more common and be part of the standard ligature
        set.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>The default language means any language in the script which
    is not specifically named. So in the above example the default
    language would be any language except Turkish and German that
    might use the latin script.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to have a default script. The digits
    0-9, are used in many writing systems, not just Latin and are
    considered Common to most scripts. If you have lookups which
    apply to the digits (conversion to oldstyle digits, or to
    proportional digits, or to superscripts...) you should attach
    those lookups to features in all scripts (and languages) that
    could use them, and to the default script (just in case).</p>

    <p>There are roughly 15 different types of lookups which
    contain different information. Different kinds of lookup are
    needed to specify ligature data, glyph substitution data and
    kerning data.</p>

    <p>Lookups may be specified with the <a href=
    "fontinfo.html#Lookups">Element-&gt;Font Info</a> dialog</p>

    <h4>Lookup subtables</h4>

    <p>I talk above about lookups as if they were simple things.
    Unfortunately they aren't. Each lookup is composed of
    "Subtables" which actually do the work.</p>

    <p>A lookup may contain several subtables. Most contain exactly
    one. (If a lookup contains no subtables it will do
    nothing).</p>

    <p>I said there were about 15 kinds of lookup, there are even
    more kinds of subtable. For instance a subtable which specifies
    glyph to glyph kerning is different from one which specifies
    glyph class to glyph class kerning.</p>

    <p>At first glance the subtable may seem an unnecessary
    complication, but it turns out to be desirable for one lookup
    to contain several kinds of sub-table data. For instance, a
    kerning lookup might include one subtable providing glyph class
    kerning, and then another subtable providing exceptions to that
    on a glyph by glyph basis.</p>

    <h4>How lookups are applied</h4>

    <p>When a word processor deals with text, it will figure out
    what script is in use in the text. Somehow it will figure out
    what the language is (maybe it will just assume the "DFLT"
    language, maybe the user told it the text was in French, maybe
    the locale is Spanish, ...).</p>

    <p>In any script/language some features are applied by default,
    while others may be applied at the user's discression. So in
    English the "liga" feature should always be applied, while the
    "dlig" feature should only be applied if the user asked for it.
    (Not all programs follow this at the moment, but that's the
    theory).</p>

    <p>The word processor will build up a list of features that
    might be active. Then it looks in the font and sees which of
    those features are available for this script and language. In
    turn each feature is composed of lookups, and all lookups in
    all active features will be marked as active.</p>

    <p>Lookups will be executed in the order in which they occur in
    the lookup list (which is also the order shown in the Font
    Info-&gt;Lookup pane, but may be quite different from the order
    in which the features were listed). And all active lookups will
    be executed.</p>

    <p>This ordering can be important. If you have both a
    small-caps lookup and a ligature lookup active, and the text is
    "fi" then the order of the lookups will probably matter. If the
    small-caps lookup happens first then the "fi" will become
    "<small>FI</small>" and the ligature feature will not be
    applied. If the ligature happens first then you will see an
    "fi" ligature for which there is probably no small-caps glyph.
    In one case you get small-caps, in another a ligature.
    Probably, here, you would like the small-caps lookup to happen
    first.</p>

    <p>Lookup subtables make life even more interesting. When a
    lookup is executed the subtables within that lookup are
    activated in turn <em>until one succeeds</em>. After that no
    further subtables will be applied.</p>

    <p>So in the kerning example mentioned above, you would want to
    put the special case glyph to glyph subtable first, and then
    the glyph class to class subtable second. When a special case
    combination occurs the first subtable will succeed (and kern
    the combination) and the class subtable will not be used. For
    combinations which aren't special cases, then the first
    subtable will fail, and the second will be applied.</p>

    <h4>GPOS and GSUB</h4>

    <p>Up till now I have spoken as there were one list of lookups.
    That was a simplification. There are two broad classes of
    lookup, and two lists. There are those involved in manipulating
    the glyphs themselves (glyph substitution, ligation,
    decomposition, etc.) and those involved in positioning glyphs
    relative to others (kerning, mark attachment, etc.).</p>

    <p>The GSUB table contains all the glyph substitution lookups
    and <em>all</em> of them will be processed before any
    positioning lookups are attempted.</p>

    <p>The GPOS table contains all the glyph positioning
    lookups.</p>

    <h3><a name="Anchors" id="Anchors">Anchor Points and
    Classes</a></h3>

    <p>Anchor points allow fine control of the positioning of two
    (or several) glyphs. There are several different styles of
    attachment based on anchors: cursive, mark to base, mark to
    ligature and mark to mark positioning. The first style is used
    to join glyphs in flowing scripts (cursive) where the exit from
    one glyph joins the entry point of the next. In the second
    style one of the glyphs is the base glyph, and it will be
    positioned normally, the other glyph which will often be a
    diacritic or vowel mark will be positioned so that the anchor
    points in each glyph are coincident. Mark to ligature behaves
    similarly to mark to base except that there may be more that
    one attachment point on the ligature depending on which
    component a given mark is connected to. Finally, mark to mark
    allows you to position two marks with respect to each other (as
    you might need to do in vietnamese or hebrew where you may get
    several marks for one glyph).</p>

    <p>That is badly said. Consider the following two glyphs and
    how they are joined to make the final result:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="a_with_anchor.png" width="104" height=
        "208" /></td>

        <td>+</td>

        <td><img src="grave_with_anchor.png" width="66" height=
        "208" /></td>

    <p>The grave accent has been raised and moved to the right so
    that its anchor point is positioned where the anchor from "a"
    was.</p>

    <p>FontForge does not compose these glyphs (well, it can, but
    that's a completely different area), instead it provides
    information within the <a href="gposgsub.html">font</a> to a
    text layout program so that the program can do the
    composition.</p>

    <p>The example above is unlikely to be very useful since most
    latin fonts contain pre-composed a-grave glyphs, but the same
    concepts apply to arabic and hebrew where the number of
    variants is larger and the precomposed glyphs fewer.</p>

    <p>That's roughly how anchor points are used. Now the
    mechanics.</p>

    <p>Each of the different attachment styles mentioned above
    (cursive, mark to base, mark to ligature and mark to mark) is a
    different type of GPOS lookup. If you want to do attachment
    positioning you must first create the appropriate lookup
    (<a href="fontinfo.html#Lookups">Element-&gt;Font
    Info-&gt;Lookups-&gt;GPOS</a>, then a lookup subtable, and then
    an anchor class within the lookup subtable. An anchor class is
    specified by providing a name for it (in the above example the
    class was called "Top").</p>

    <p>Cursive attachments are a little different from the other
    attachment types. Each glyph has two attachment points, an
    entry and an exit (instead of just the one shown in the mark to
    base example above). The text layout program will attach the
    exit point of one glyph to the entry point of the next.</p>

    <p>A glyph may contain several Anchor Points, but only one for
    each mark to base anchor class (ligatures may have more than
    one for a class, and 'curs' and 'mkmk' classes will usually
    have two). Inside a glyph may create a point with the <a href=
    "pointmenu.html#AddAnchor">Point-&gt;Add Anchor command</a>.
    You must specify an anchor class, and whether this point is in
    a base glyph or in a mark glyph, and a location. So in the
    example above the anchor point in "a" has class "Top" and is a
    base glyph, while the anchor point in "grave" also has class
    "Top" but is a mark glyph. There may be many base glyphs with
    an anchor point named "Top" and many mark glyphs also with
    "Top" anchor points. Any base glyph with a "Top" anchor point
    maybe composed with any mark glyph with a "Top" anchor point.
    So instead of specifying the exact composed form for all
    possible combinations we specify far fewer anchor points for
    the same effect.</p>

    <p>But life is not really that simple. Ligatures may need
    several anchor points of the same class (one above each
    component for example). When you create your anchor point you
    may say that it is to be in a ligature, in which case you will
    also be asked for a ligature index -- a number running from 0
    to the number of components in the ligature -1. This allows you
    to position several anchor points with the same class. The text
    layout program will place the first mark over the first anchor
    point, the second mark over the second and so on (this is a
    gross simplification).</p>

    <p>Finally you may need to position two marks based on the same
    anchor point, for example the glyph <img src=
    "a_dieresis_macron.png" width="9" height="14" /> has a
    diaeresis and a macron over it. Both of which might normally be
    positioned with the Top anchor class. Instead we define a
    special class for positioning one mark with respect to another.
    When creating the anchor class specify a tag of 'mkmk' (mark to
    mark) and call it something like "TopMark". When you create a
    new anchor point for diaeresis you specify that it is a
    <em>base mark</em> and you position it above the glyph, while
    the new anchor point in macron should be of type mark and
    should be positioned at the same place as the "Top" anchor
    point. Thus when given the sequence of glyphs "a diaeresis
    macron" the text layout program should position "a" normally,
    position "diaeresis" so that the its Top anchor point is where
    "a"'s is, and position macron so that its TopMark anchor point
    is where "diaeresis"'s is.</p>

    <p>Anchor points may be selected, dragged, transformed, cut,
    copied and pasted.</p>

    <h3><a name="Baseline" id="Baseline">Baseline</a>s</h3>

    <p>To a user of the latin alphabet it makes sense for the
    vertical origin of a glyph to be the baseline on which most
    letters rest<img src="latinBaseline.png" width="93" height=
    "45" />. This means that if you change the pointsize of a glyph
    it will still line up properly<img src=
    "latinNormalBaseline.png" width="91" height="21" />. This is so
    obvious we don't even think about it. But if you put the
    vertical origin at the top of the letter then the letters will
    be aligned quite differently, and to our eyes,
    unexpectedly<img src="latinHangBaseline.png" width="90" height=
    "21" />.</p>

    <p>Different scripts have different expectations of how glyphs
    should be aligned. In latin (cyrillic, greek, arabic, hebrew,
    etc.) the alignment point, the baseline, is somewhere in the
    middle of the possible extent of a glyph -- that is the script
    has both ascenders above the baseline and descenders below
    it.</p>

    <p>But not all scripts are like that. In Devanagari the
    alignment point is near the top of the glyph -- indeed most
    glyphs will draw in the baseline explicitly<img src=
    "devaBaseline.png" width="97" height="46" />. If you change the
    pointsize you want glyphs to line up on this line<img src=
    "devaHangBaseline.png" width="82" height="21" />, and not down
    at the bottom of the glyph <img src="devaLatinBaseline.png"
    width="76" height="18" />.</p>

    <p>In CJK ideographs the baseline is usually drawn at the
    bottom edge of the square which contains the glyph.</p>

    <p>However if you try and typeset these different scripts
    together with their baselines in the same place you get a mess:
    <img src="misalignedBaselines.png" width="65" height="38" />.
    It would be much nicer if it were possible to say that these
    different scripts have their baselines in different places so
    that the glyphs can fit together reasonably:<img src=
    "alignedBaselines.png" width="65" height="23" />. Both Apple
    Typography and OpenType allow for this. There is a <a href=
    "baseline.html">baseline table</a> which says how the baselines
    for each script (or each glyph) should be aligned with respect
    to other baselines.</p>

    <h3><a name="FontView" id="FontView">Font View</a></h3>

    <p>The <a href="fontview.html">font view</a> displays all the
    glyphs in the font (or all that will fit in the window). Every
    line has two parts, at the top is a label, often small clear
    letters, underneath that, somewhat larger is a 24 pixel
    rasterization of the font you have designed. As you edit a
    glyph in an <a href="#CharView">outline glyph view</a> its
    small version in the font view will change as you work.</p>

    <p>Double-clicking on a glyph will bring up an outline glyph
    view of that glyph which will allow you to edit it.</p>

    <p>Selecting several glyphs will allow you to apply various
    operations to all of them, or to cut and paste them.</p>

    <p><img src="AmbrosiaFV.png" width="423" height="226" /></p>

    <p>Fonts do not need to be for the latin alphabet alone. Below
    is a view of one of <a href=

    <h3><a name="CharView" id="CharView">Outline Glyph
    View</a></h3>

    <p>The <a href="charview.html">outline view</a> is probably the
    most complex view in FontForge. This is where you actually edit
    the splines (<a href="bezier.html">BÃ©zier splines</a>) that
    make up your glyphs.</p>

    <p>You may have a background image loaded into the view to help
    you trace out the shape you are working on (it is displayed in
    grey). There are various grid lines visible, some created by
    default (the baseline, the ascent line, the descent line, and a
    line at x=0), you may add others yourself.</p>

    <p>There is a layer showing the glyph's hints.</p>

    <p>In the foreground are the splines and points of the glyph
    itself, and the width line (you may adjust the glyph's width by
    moving this line). If a point is selected then its control
    points will be displayed.</p>

    <p>To the left of the main window (the image below shows them
    on the right, that was just to keep them from crowding things,
    you can move them around) are two palettes, one a palette of
    tools, and the other a palette controlling what layers
    (foreground, background, grid, hints) are visible and
    editable.</p>

    <p><img src="charview2.png" width="544" height="656" /></p>

    <h3><a name="BitmapView" id="BitmapView">Bitmap View</a></h3>

    <p>The <a href="bitmapview.html">bitmap view</a> is similar to
    the outline view above. It also has a tools and layer
    palette.</p>

    <p>This allows you to edit bitmap versions of the outline
    glyphs you create above.</p>

    <p>In the background is a small rendition of the outline, and
    in the foreground are the bits of the image. You may make the
    program calculate which bits should be set by pressing the
    "Recalculate button", the results usually need to be tweaked by
    hand. In the upper left corner is a full sized image of your
    bitmap glyph.</p>

    <p><img src="BitmapView.png" width="254" height="273" /></p>

    <h3><a name="MetricsView" id="MetricsView">Metrics
    View</a></h3>

    <p>The <a href="metricsview.html">metrics view</a> allows you
    to see how the glyphs look together.</p>

    <p>You can change the width and left/right bearings of a glyph,
    either by dragging in the upper part of the window or by
    entering an appropriate number in the lower.</p>

    <p>You can also provide kerning information for any two
    adjacent glyphs. You can view how various OpenType features
    affect the glyph stream</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="MetricsView.png" width="479" height=
        "331" /></td>

        <td><img src="MetricsView-features.png" width="463" height=
        "330" /></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p><img src="VerticalMetrics.png" width="270" height="573"
    align="right" />Note that in Hebrew, or Arabic (or any other
    right to left alphabet) the glyphs will start on the right and
    run to the left. While in CJK fonts you may want to see things
    arranged vertically.</p>
