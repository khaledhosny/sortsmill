    <h1>Major differences between FontForge's and Adobe's
    interpretation of feature files</h1>

    <p>Not really any, any more. Except that FontForge supports
    much of the syntax which adobe documents but does not support.
    Adobe continues to reserve the right to change the syntax of
    anything they do not currently support.</p>

    <p>In November 2008 Adobe made radical changes to the feature
    file format. This meant that my extensions were no longer
    needed. It also as an incompatible change from the earlier
    format. FontForge should (still) be able to parse files written
    in the earlier format, as well as files written in the new
    format. It will only produce files in the new format now
    (actually there is a compile time flag which will revert output
    to the old format, but I haven't tested it).</p>

    <h2>Parsing a feature file</h2>

    <p>Use <code><a href=
    "filemenu.html#Merge-feature">File-&gt;Merge Feature
    Info</a></code> (formerly <code>File-&gt;Merge Kern
    Info</code>)</p>

    <h2>Outputting a feature file</h2>

    <p>Use <code><a href="fontinfo.html#Lookups">Element-&gt;Font
    Info-&gt;Lookups</a></code>, then right click on any lookup (to
    produce a popup menu) and select <code>Save Feature
    File</code></p>

    <p>You can also generate a feature file containing a single
    lookup by selecting that lookup, producing the popup menu and
    selecting <code>Save Lookup</code></p>
