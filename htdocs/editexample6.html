    <h2><a name="Variants" id="Variants">Glyph</a> Variants</h2>

    <p>In many scripts glyphs have several variant glyphs. In latin
    the most obvious example is that every letter has both an upper
    case and a lower case variant. A more esoteric example would be
    that in renaissance times the long-s variant (of s) was used
    initially and medially in a word, while the short-s was only
    used at the end of a word.</p>

    <p>Most Arabic glyphs have four variants (initial, medial,
    final and isolated).</p>

    <p>The digits often have several variants: tabular digits
    (where all digits have the same advance width so that tables of
    numbers don't look ragged), proportional digits (where each
    digit has a width appropriate to its shape) and old-style or
    lower case digits (<img src="lcdigits.png" width="76" height=
    "18" align="middle" />) where some digits have descenders and
    others have ascenders.</p>

    <p>Some of these variants are built into the encodings (the
    upper and lower case distinction is), but in other cases you
    should provide extra information in the font so that the word
    processor can be aware of the variants (Arabic is midway
    between the two, the various forms are in the encoding, but you
    need to provide extra information as well).</p>

    <p><img src="subtable-oldstyle.png" width="421" height="287"
    align="right" />Let us consider the case of the digits
    mentioned above. Assume that the glyph called "one" contains
    the tabular variant of one, the glyph "one.prop" contains the
    proportional variant and "one.oldstyle" contains the lower-case
    variant, and so on for all the other digits. Before you do
    anything else you must create two <a href=
    "editexample4.html#lookups">lookups</a> and associated
    subtables (I shan't go into that again. Here the lookup type is
    "Single Substitution", and the features are "pnum" for
    Proportional Numbers and "onum" for Oldstyle Figures. Also the
    digits aren't in any single script, but are in many, so make
    this feature apply to multiple scripts (including "DFLT").</p>

    <p>When FontForge brings up the dialog to fill in the oldstyle
    lookup subtable notice that there is a button [Default Using
    Suffix:] followed by a text field containing a suffix. Set the
    text field to "oldstyle" and press the button. It will search
    through all glyphs in all the scripts of the feature and find
    any "oldstyle" variants of them and populate the table with
    them.</p>

    <p><img src="glyphinfo-one.png" width="431" height="310" align=
    "left" />Sometimes it makes more sense to think of all the
    substitutions available for a specific glyph (rather than all
    substitutions in a specific lookup). So instead if filling up
    the subtable dialog for "Proportional Numbers" let us instead
    select "one" from the fontview, <code><a href=
    "charinfo.html#substitution">Element-&gt;Glyph Info</a></code>,
    select the <code>Substitutions</code> tab and press the
    <code>&lt;New&gt;</code> button.</p>

    <p>(Note: Type0, Type1 and Type3 PostScript fonts have no
    notation to handle this. You need to be creating an OpenType or
    TrueType font for these variants to be output).</p>

    <h3><a name="Conditional" id="Conditional">Conditional</a>
    Variants</h3>

    <p>FontForge supports OpenType's Contextual Substitution and
    Chaining Contextual Substitution sub-tables, and to a lesser
    extent, Apple's contextual glyph substitution sub-table. This
    means that you can insert conditional variants into your font.
    <a href="editexample6-5.html#Conditional">The next page</a>
    will go into this in greater detail.</p>

    <h2><a name="Marks" id="Marks">Anchoring</a> marks</h2>

    <p>Some scripts (Arabic, Hebrew) need vowel marks placed around
    the main text glyphs. Other scripts (some variants of Latin and
    Greek) have so many possible accent combinations that having
    preassembled glyphs for all combinations is unwieldy.</p>

    <p>In OpenType (which includes MicroSoft's TrueType fonts) it
    is possible to indicate on all base glyphs where marks should
    attach, and on all marks where the base glyphs should attach.
    Thus one could put an anchor centered above a lowercase-a
    indicating that all accents (acute, grave, umlaut, circumflex,
    tilde, macron, ring, caron, ...) should attach there, and
    underneath all the accents one could put another anchor so that
    when the two glyphs are adjacent in the text the word-processor
    will know where to place the accent so that it rides above the
    "a".</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="a_with_anchor.png" width="104" height=
        "208" /></td>

        <td>+</td>

        <td><img src="grave_with_anchor.png" width="66" height=
        "208" /></td>

        <td>=&gt;</td>

        <td><img src="agrave_anchored.png" width="104" height=
        "208" /></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Not all accents ride centered above the letter (the dot and
    ogonek ride below the letter), so you may need more than one
    anchor for different styles of attachment.</p>

    <p>Finally some letters can have multiple attachments, unicode
    U+1EA4, for example, is an A with a circumflex and an acute.
    Normally the circumflex and the acute will attach at the same
    point, which would be ugly and confusing. Instead we create a
    different kind of anchor, a mark to mark anchor, on the
    circumflex and allow the acute accent to attach to that.</p>

    <p>Before one can create an anchor in a glyph one must (of
    course) create a lookup and subtable. This is another Glyph
    Positioning lookup (so you enter it in the GPOS pane). Once you
    have created the subtable you will be presented with another
    dialog asking for anchor classes, you must create an <a href=
    "overview.html#Anchors">anchor class</a> for each type of
    attachment (thus in the case of A above with two types of
    attachments (one above and one below) you would create two
    anchor classes.</p>

    <p>Then for each glyph in which an attachment will be made, you
    should first click at the point where the anchor is to be
    created and then bring up the <code><a href=
    "pointmenu.html#AddAnchor">Point-&gt;Add Anchor</a></code>
    dialog.</p>

    <p>You can examine (and correct) how a glyph fits to any others
    that combine with it by using the <code><a href=
    "viewmenu.html#AnchorControl">View-&gt;Anchor
    Control...</a></code> command.</p>

    <p><span class="c3"><strong>A warning about mark
    attachments:</strong></span> Not all software supports them.
    And even more confusing software may support them for some
    scripts and not for others.</p>
