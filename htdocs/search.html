    <p>FontForge will allow you to search a font for all glyphs
    containing a certain shape and optionally replace that shape
    with another shape.</p>

    <p>FontForge allows you to control whether a match will be
    found even if the shape has undergone certain transformations
    (ie. rotated, scaled, flipped, etc.).</p>

    <p>The search will be on a point by point basis. That is, the
    first point of the search pattern will be moved to a point in
    the glyph being searched, and all subsequent points and control
    points in the search pattern must lie exactly on top of an
    equivalent point in the glyph.</p>

    <p>Of course if a transformation is allowed, then it is the
    transformed search pattern which must match.</p>

    <p>Normally FontForge will search all glyphs in a font, but you
    may restrict the search so that only those glyphs which are
    selected will be tested.</p>

    <p>The search and replace panes behave very much like the
    outline glyph views and you may draw within them using the
    tools available in the outline view. The menu at the top of the
    window is a subset of the menu in the outline glyph view. Only
    one of the two panes is active at a given time, and the menu
    works on the active one. You can make a pane active by clicking
    in it, or by using the [Tab] key.</p>

    <p>The <code>[Find]</code> button will start at the beginning
    of the font and search for the first glyph containing the
    search pattern and then open an outline glyph view looking at
    that glyph. After <code>[Find]</code> has been used once the
    button changes to <code>[Find Next]</code> whose behavior is
    similar excepts that it starts at the last glyph found and
    displays the next glyph in the same window.</p>

    <p>The <code>[Find All]</code> button will select all glyphs
    containing the pattern.</p>

    <p>The <code>[Replace]</code> button only works after a
    <code>[Find]/[Find Next]/[Replace]</code>. It replaces the
    thing found with the replace pattern, and does another
    <code>[Find Next]</code>.</p>

    <p>The <code>[Replace All]</code> button replaces all instances
    of the search pattern with the replace pattern and selects all
    glyphs found.</p>

    <p>There are three different kinds of search, and which is used
    depends on the shapes in the patterns. If the search pattern
    contains a closed path or multiple paths, then the search looks
    for an exact match, ie. for each path in the search pattern
    there must be a path in the glyph which matches it exactly.
    Whereas, if the search pattern is a single open path then the
    search will look for the search pattern <i>within</i> any path.
    And a variant of this last-- if the <code>[] Endpoints specify
    minimum length and direction only</code> box is checked, then
    the end points of the search pattern will not be matched, only
    the points between them will match -- This may seem rather odd,
    but it allows you to match something like "all right angles"
    where you neither know nor care how long the segments are on
    either side of the right angle.</p>

    <p>The way a replacement happens will depend on the type of
    search.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>In a contour search (the first type above) all matching
      contours will be removed, and the replacement contours will
      be copied in.</li>

      <li>In a segment match the matched points will be removed
      from the contour and the replacement points will be added in
      their place. Note that the order in which you draw the two
      patterns is important, and the start point of the replacement
      will go where the start point of the search pattern came
      from. If you draw your patterns in the wrong direction you
      will not get the effect you want. Similarly, in most cases
      you will want the distance between the start point and end
      point of the search pattern to be the same as the equivalent
      distance in the replace pattern (else you will get odd jumps
      in your results).</li>

      <li>If the endpoints of the search pattern are not explicitly
      matched, then the end points of the replace pattern will not
      be used either. The end points of the replace pattern are
      simply used to position the replacement. So the first point
      matched will correspond to the second point in the search
      pattern; FontForge will figure out where the first point of
      the search pattern would lie; it will then position the first
      point of the replace pattern there, and use that to figure
      out where the real replacement points should go. It's hard to
      explain in words, but fairly obvious in a picture:

        <table>
          <tr>
            <td><img src="rplsansserifs.png" width="654" height=
            "431" /></td>

            <td><img src="rplprocess.png" width="139" height=
            "431" /></td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>The above could be used to convert a san-serif font into
        a serifed one (simplifying grossly). The end point of the
        search pattern is the same distance from its start point as
        is the end point of the replace pattern. The first (only)
        point matched in the search pattern is the right angle
        point. There is no point in the replace pattern that
        corresponds to it, so nothing in the replace pattern can be
        aligned with it, but given that point we can extrapolate
        backwards where the start point would be, then lay a
        virtual replacement point on top of it, and place the other
        replacement points normally.</p>

        <p>Now the end points also specify a minimum distance which
        must be matched. This is important because the replacement
        pattern also contains a right angle. You would not want
        FontForge recursively placing smaller and smaller serifs
        onto already existing ones.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>At the moment I see two possible uses for the replace
    feature:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>It can help you change the style of serifs in your font
      (see the example below)</li>

      <li>FontForge can't always detect which glyphs should contain
      references when reading in opentype (and some type1) fonts.
      You can use the replace feature to fix up all things that
      look like "A" with a reference to A. (see the first example
      above)</li>
    </ol>
