    <p>This dialog either displays all kerning pairs in the entire
    font, or all kerning pairs associated with a character (if it
    is invoked from the outline view).</p>

    <p>You may choose at what pixel size to view the pairs. Each
    pair is drawn kerned so you can see at a glance those that are
    too close. Underneath the pair is the kerning offset.</p>

    <p>You may change the kerning by moving the mouse to the right
    hand character of a pair, depressing the button and moving the
    character around. The display is updated as you move it. All
    kern offsets that have been changed will be displayed in red
    (in the example at right, the "AT" pair has been changed).</p>

    <p>You may select a kern pair by clicking on them. Once a
    selection has been made you may use the up and down arrows to
    step to the next or previous pair. For more accurate
    positioning you may alter the kerning by using the left or
    right arrows, each alters the kerning by one unit (if you hold
    down the shift or control keys and use the arrows the kerning
    is altered by 10 units).</p>

    <p>You may double click on a kern pair to get the <a href=
    "metricsview.html#kernpair">Kern Pair Closeup</a> dlg.</p>

    <p>You may undo the last change by pressing ^Z. You may revert
    the currently selected pair to its original value by pressing
    Meta-Z (Alt-Z).</p>

    <p>You may control the order in which the kerning pairs are
    displayed, they may be sorted by:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The left hand character first and the right hand
      character second</li>

      <li>The right hand character first and the left hand
      character second</li>

      <li>The (absolute value of the) kerning offset</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you type a character (or use <a href=
    "metricsview.html#Entering">F12 to get characters you can't
    type</a>), then the dlg will scroll to display the pairs
    associated with that character. The behavior depends in an
    obvious way on how the dlg is sorted.</p>
