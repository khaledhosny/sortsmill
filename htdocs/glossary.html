              Abjad is the technical term for the type of writing
              system used by Semitic languages (Hebrew, Arabic,
              etc.), where there are glyphs for all the consonants
              but the reader must be prepared to guess what vowel
              to add between two consonants.

              <p>Both Hebrew and Arabic have optional vowel marks
              and are called "impure" abjads. Ancient Phoenician
              had nothing but consonants and is a "pure" abjad.</p>

            <dd>
              An abugida is somewhere in between an <a href=
              "#alphabet">alphabet</a> and a <a href=
              "#syllabary">syllabary</a>. The Indic writing systems
              are probably the best known abugidas.

              <p>In most abugidas there are independant glyphs for
              the consonants, and each consonant is implicitly
              followed by a default vowel sound. All vowels other
              than the default will be marked by either diacritics
              or some other modification to the base consonant.</p>

              <p>An abugida differs from a syllabary in that there
              is a common theme to the the images representing a
              syllable beginning with a given consonant (that is,
              the glyph for the consonant), while in a syllabary
              each syllable is distinct even if two start with a
              common consonant.</p>

              <p>An abugida differs from an abjad in that vowels
              (other than the default) must be marked in the
              abugida.</p>

            a different place for different scripts. In Indic
            scripts most letters descend below the baseline. In CJK
            scripts there is also a vertical baseline usually in
            the middle of the glyph. The <a href=

              Sometimes it is important to indicate that a

              a width of -20, if at the bottom use -21. Ghost hints

              fonts or scripts there may be several glyphs per

              used initially and medially, the other, the short-s,

              A multiple master font is a PostScript font schema

              Multiple master fonts can vary along several axes,
              for example you might have a multiple master which
              defined both different weights and different widths
              of a font family, it could be used to generate: Thin,

            <dd>In order for the curved shape of the "O" to appear
            to be the same height as the flat top of the "I" it
            tends to "overshoot" the cap-height (or x-height), or
            undershoot the baseline by about 3% of the cap-height
            (or x-height). For a triangular shape (such as "A") the
            overshoot is even greater, perhaps 5%.<br />
            These guidelines are based on the way the eye works and
            the optical illusions it generates and are taken from
            Peter Karow's <i>Digital Formats for Typefaces</i>, p.
            26).<br />
            The overshoot is also dependant on the point-size of a
            font, the larger the point-size the smaller the
            overshoot should be. Generally modern fonts will be
            used at multiple point-sizes, but in some font families
            there are multiple faces for the different point-sizes,
            and in such a case the overshoot will probably vary
            from face to face.<br />

            around just as any other points may be moved -- thus
            changing the left-side-bearing or the advance width.
            Early versions of TrueType supplied just these two

              font heights.

            <dd>
              A point is a unit of measurement. There were three
              (at least) different definitions for "point" in
              common usage before the advent of computers. The one
              in use in the Anglo-Saxon printing world was the
              "pica point" with 72.27 points per inch ( 2.85pt /mm
              ), while the one used in continental Europe was the
              didot point with 62 <sup>2</sup>/<small>3</small>
              points per 23.566mm ( 2.66pt/mm or 67.54pt/inch ) and
              the French sometimes used the Mediaan point (72.78
              points per inch, 2.86pt/mm).

              <p>The didiot and pica points were so arranged that
              text at a given point-size would have approximately
              the same <a href="#cap-height">cap-height</a> in both
              systems, the didot point would have extra white-space
              above the capitals to contain the accents present in
              most non-English Latin based scripts.</p>

              <p>This has the interesting side effect that a font
              designed for European usage should have a smaller
              proportion of the vertical em given over to the text
              body. I believe that computer fonts tend to ignore
              this, so presumably european printers now set with
              more leading.</p>

              <p>As far as I can tell, computers tend to work in
              approximations to pica points (but this may be
              because I am in the US), PostScript uses a unit of
              1/72nd of an inch.</p>

              <p>Originally fonts were not described by point size,
              but by <a href="#type-size-names">name</a>. It was
              not until the 1730s that Pierre Fournier that created
              the point system for specifying font heights. This
              was later improved upon by François Didiot (whence
              the name of the point). In 1878 the Chicago Type
              Foundry first used a point system in the US. In 1886
              the US point was standardized -- the pica was defined
              to be 35/83cm, and the pica point defined to be
              1/12th of that.</p>

            <dd>
              PostScript is a page-layout language used by many
              printers. The language contains the specifications of
              several different font formats. The main (FontForge)
              manual has a section describing how <a href=
              "overview.html#PT">PostScript differs from
              TrueType</a>.

              <ul>
                <li>Type 1 -- This is the old standard for
                PostScript fonts. Such a font generally has the
                extension .pfb (or .pfa). A type 1 font is limited
                to a one byte encoding (ie. only 256 glyphs may be
                encoded).</li>

                <li>Type 2/CFF -- This is the format used within
                <a href="#opentype">OpenType</a> fonts. It is
                almost the same as Type 1, but has a few extensions
                and a more compact format. It is usually inside a
                CFF wrapper, which is usually inside an OpenType
                font. The CFF font format again only allows a 1
                byte encoding, but the OpenType wrapper extends
                this to provide more complex encoding types.</li>

                <li>Type 3 -- This format allows full postscript
                within the font, but it means that no <a href=
                "#hints">hints</a> are allowed, so these fonts will
                not look as nice at small point-sizes. Also most
                (screen) rasterizers are incapable of dealing with
                them. A type 3 font is limited to a one byte
                encoding (ie. only 256 glyphs may be encoded).</li>

                <li>Type 0 -- This format is used for collecting
                many sub-fonts (of Type 1, 2 or 3) into one big
                font with a multi-byte encoding, and was used for
                CJK or Unicode fonts.</li>

                <li>Type 42 -- A <a href="#truetype">TrueType</a>
                font wrapped up in PostScript. Sort of the opposite
                from OpenType.</li>

                <li>CID -- This format is used for CJK fonts with
                large numbers of glyphs. The glyphs themselves are
                specified either as type1 or type2 glyph format.
                The CID font itself has no encoding, just a mapping
                from CID (a number) to glyph. An set of external
                CMAP files are used to provide appropriate
                encodings as needed.</li>

              Back two thousand years ago when the Romans were
              carving their letters on stone monuments, they
              discovered that they could reduce the chance of the
              stone cracking by adding fine lines at the
              terminations of the main stems of a glyph.

              <p>These fine lines were called serifs, and came to
              have an esthetic appeal of their own. Early type
              designers added them to their fonts for esthetic
              rather than functional reasons.</p>

              <p>At the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the
              twentieth centuries, type-designers started designing
              fonts without serifs. These were initially called
              grotesques because their form appeared so strange,
              they are now generally called sans-serif.</p>

              <p>Other writing systems (Hebrew for one) have their
              own serifs. Hebrew serifs are rather different from
              latin (cyrillic, greek) serifs and I don't know their
              history. Hebrew serifs only occur at the top of a
              glyph</p>

              <p>I would welcome examples from other scripts of
              serifed and sans-serifed glyphs.</p>

              A syllabary is a phonetic writing system like an
              alphabet. Unlike an alphabet the sound-unit which is
              written is a syllable rather than a phoneme. In
              Japanese KataKana the sound "ka" is represented by
              one glyph. Syllabaries tend to be bigger than
              alphabets (Japanese KataKana requires about 60
              different characters, while the Korean Hangul
              requires tens of thousands).
