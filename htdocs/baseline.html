  "right" />This dialog may be invoked by <code>Element-&gt;Other
  Info-&gt;Horizontal Baselines</code> (or <code>Vertical
  Baselines</code>). It allows you to control the baseline (in
  either horizontal or vertical orientation) on which the glyphs of
  a particular script line up. You may also control the spacing
  between baselines, and the interline (or intercolumn) spacing on
  a per-script, or even per-language basis.</p>

  <p>See the <a href="overview.html#Baseline">Baseline section</a>
  in the overview for a description of why this is important.</p>

  <p>There are currently seven standard baselines. The distinctions
  between them are described in the OpenType standard. (See the
  <a href=
  "http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/opentype/index_tag4.html">
  baseline tags section</a>)</p>

  <p>Basically most alphabetic scripts will use the 'romn'
  baseline, most CJK scripts will use the 'ideo'graphic baseline.
  Tibetan and other Indic scripts will use the 'hang'ing baseline,
  and math fonts might use the 'math' baseline.</p>

  <p>Roughly the ideographic baseline will line up with the
  descenders of a Latin (Greek, Cyrillic) script, and the hanging
  baseline will line up with the ascenders.</p>

  <p>You need to select which baselines your font will support. You
  may want to specify baselines that apply to scripts which aren't
  in your font -- this will mean your font is positioned reasonable
  when used with glyphs from other fonts. In the example above, the
  font has no Indic characters, but it still specifies a hanging
  baseline.</p>

  <p>You select which baselines you will support by turning on the
  appropriate checkboxes. All scripts will have the same set of
  baselines. In every script one baseline will be the default
  baseline. Generally glyphs in that script will be drawn with
  their vertical origin (If you are working on horizontal
  baselines, that is) on that baseline. You then should specify how
  other baselines are offset from this one.<br clear="all" /></p>

  <p><img src="BASElang.png" width="439" height="305" align=
  "left" />You may also set the minimum and maximum extent of the
  font for each script (by pressing the <code>[Set Extents]</code>
  button). This corresponds roughly to a per-script line spacing
  (or column spacing).</p>

  <p>You may specify a default spacing for the script in general,
  and then more specific spacings for a given language.</p>

  <p>In the example at left the default spacing for the Latin
  script allows room for one accent above capital letters. Now
  English doesn't have any accents (usually), so it might make
  sense that English could use a tighter line spacing (and,
  traditionally this has been done). On the other hand Vietnamese
  stacks multiple accents above one another, so it needs more room
  than the default.</p>

  <p>But suppose you are typesetting French. Now French sometimes
  is printed with capital accented letters, but sometimes a "Ã€"
  will be drawn just as "A" with no accent. So you might create at
  feature that maps capital accented letters to their unaccented
  forms:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
feature NoAc {
  sub Agrave by A;
  sub Aacute by A;
  ...
  sub Egrave by E;
  ...
} NoAc;
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Then it would be convenient to be change the baseline spacing
  if these feature were active. And, indeed you can. Simply select
  the line for French (in this case the default language works for
  French) and press the [Set Feature Extents] button.</p>

  "252" /></p>

  <p>It is possible to set Extent information even if you do not
  provide baseline data (that is, if all the baselines are
  unselected).</p>
