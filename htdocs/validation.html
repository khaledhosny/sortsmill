    <h1 class="c1">Font Validation window</h1>

    <p><img src="validation.png" width="328" height="482" align=
    "right" />Both PostScript and TrueType impose some restrictions
    on the data that define a font. Before you save a font you
    should do a quick check (well... it's not always quick) to
    insure that you are not breaking any rules.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>No open contours</li>

      <li>No paths may intersect.</li>

      <li>All paths must be drawn in a consistent direction.
      Clockwise for external paths, anti-clockwise for internal
      paths. (Actually PostScript requires the exact opposite, but
      FontForge reverses PostScript contours when it loads them so
      that everything is consistant internally -- and reverses them
      again when it saves them, of course).</li>

      <li>There may be no flipped references (this is a special
      case of the above, a flipped reference will have its contours
      drawn in the wrong direction).</li>

      <li>There must be points everywhere a contour attains a local
      maximum or minimum, horizontally or vertically. (Actually
      there are exceptions to this rule, for small curved sections
      like serifs. The exception is not defined very well, and
      FontForge makes a guess and will not report errors if the
      spline is small -- but the actual definition of "small" is
      somewhat arbitrary).</li>

      <li>The coordinate offsets between adjacent points (or
      control points) must not be greater than 32767.</li>

      <li>All opentype substitution commands must refer to real
      glyphs.</li>

      <li>In PostScript fonts there is a limit of 1500 points in a
      glyph.</li>

      <li>In PostScript fonts there is a limit of 96 hints in a
      glyph.</li>

      <li>In PostScript, non-cid-keyed fonts, glyph names may not
      be longer than 31 characters and may contain only "A"-"Z",
      "a"-"z", "0"-"9", "_" and ".". (If you have the
      UnicodeGlyphNames preference item check, FontForge disables
      this check because it assumes you know what you are doing and
      you are planning to rename the glyphs before they get saved
      anyway).</li>

      <li>In a TrueType font, point coordinates must be
      integral.</li>

      <li>Missing anchor. According to the opentype spec, if a
      glyph contains an anchor point for one anchor class in a
      subtable, it must contain anchor points for all anchor
      classes in the subtable. Even it, logically, they do not
      apply and are unnecessary.</li>

      <li>Duplicate glyph name. Two (or more) glyphs in this font
      have the same name. When outputting a PostScript font only
      one of them will ever be seen.

        <p>It's a little hard to detect this in normal use, but if
        you change the encoding to "Glyph Order", and then use
        Edit-&gt;Select-&gt;Wildcard and enter the glyph name, both
        of them should be selected.</p>
      </li>

      <li>Duplicate unicode code point. Two (or more) glyphs in
      this font have the code point. When outputting an sfnt
      (TrueType/OpenType) font only one of them will ever be seen.

        <p>It's a little hard to detect this in normal use, but if
        you change the encoding to "Glyph Order", and then use
        Edit-&gt;Select-&gt;Wildcard and enter the code point, both
        of them should be selected.</p>
      </li>

      <li>Check that the OS/2 version number is valid.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Validating a font can take a long time. So FontForge caches
    the validation state of each glyph (saving it to the sfd file
    so it is valid across invocations) and will only validate those
    glyphs which have changed since the last validation. This means
    that although the first validation may be slow, subsequent
    validations will probably be very fast -- so don't be
    discouraged by the time it takes to do this the first time.</p>

    <p>(If, for some reason, you need to revalidate, then right
    clicking in the window will give you a menu where "Revalidate
    All" is an option).</p>

    <p>The Validation window will recheck the state of the font as
    you edit it. So if you leave the window open you will see
    glyphs popping into the window and out of it as you create and
    fix problems.</p>

    <p>If you double click on a line in the window then FontForge
    will open an outline glyph editing window for that glyph, and
    run a small version of <a href="problems.html">Element-&gt;Find
    Problems</a> to help you track down exactly where in the glyph
    the error(s) occurred.</p>

    <p>If you right click, you will get a popup menu which has
    various options which may fix some of the problems in the
    glyph. There are also options to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>scroll the window to display the errors of a particular
      glyph</li>

      <li>revalidate the glyph (usually this happens when needed...
      but just in case fontforge screws up this option is
      present)</li>

      <li>revalidate all glyphs (again, I hope this won't be needed
      -- but just in case)</li>

      <li>Select all glyphs with a particular error in the font
      view</li>

      <li>Try to do a batch fix of all glyphs with a particular
      error.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I say that these options "may" fix problems. Let me give
    some examples where they can't.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If a glyph contains a reference which is drawn in the
      wrong direction then you can't fix it in the refering
      glyph.</li>

      <li>If a glyph contains two references which intersect one
      another, then Remove Overlap can't fix them. You must inline
      the references before you can correct them.</li>

      <li>The normal Add Extrema command is cautious about adding
      extrema which would be very close to the end-points of a
      spline (because when you round those points to integers they
      may end up lying right on top of the end points, or because
      rounding the control points may cause significant distortion
      of the spline's shape). Unfortunately these are exactly the
      cases which are most likely to occur. So FontForge has two
      variants of Add Extrema, which which adds what it thinks are
      "Good" extrema, and one which will add all extrema even if
      they are likely to cause problems later.

        <p>When the Add Good Extrema command does not fix your
        problem, you may be better off examining the glyph yourself
        and seeing if you can redesign it manually.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>There is another pair of entries in the menu which sort of
    postpone dealing with the issue. Consider the glyphs Aring,
    Ccedilla and Oogonek. Frequently these glyphs are designed so
    that the accent will overlap the base letter. One would like to
    leave the glyph as being made up of references, but one would
    like to get rid of the overlap when the font is generated.
    There is a special flag in <a href=
    "charinfo.html"><code>Element-&gt;Glyph
    Info-&gt;Unicode-&gt;Mark for Unlink, Remove Overlap before
    Save</code></a> which will make fontforge unlink a glyph's
    references, and then run Element-&gt;Remove Overlap on them
    just before saving them. Then after saving it will reverse the
    operation and leave you with the original references.</p>

    <p>So there are a pair of menu items (one for the current
    glyph, one for all glyphs that meet certain criteria) which
    will set this flag for the relevant glyph(s). Once this flag is
    set FontForge will no longer report that the glyph
    self-intersects.</p>
