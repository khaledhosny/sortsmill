    <p>FontForge uses a standard mechanism called gettext to
    provide translations of user interface strings into different
    language. Gettext is described profusely at the <a href=
    "http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/">gettext site</a>,
    the following are some brief notes on what you need to know to
    translate FontForge's UI.</p>

    <ul>

      strings</a></li>

      already existing "po" file</a></li>

      <li><a href="#HotKeys">Different hot keys</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p><br clear="all" /></p>

    <h2><a name="Obtaining" id="Obtaining">Obtaining</a> the
    strings</h2>

    <p>In a gettext based package, the translatable strings live in
    a "pot" file. In FontForge's case it is called
    "FontForge.pot".</p>

    <p>You can download the <a href="FontForge.pot.bz2">current
    version of this file from here;</a> it will be updated at least
    each time I make a release and possibly more frequently. 
    <!--<P>
  Each source distribution I make contains the then current FontForge.pot file
  in the top level directory of the distribution. You may find a copy of the
  <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fontforge/files/fontforge-source/">current
  distribution on sourceforge</A>, it will be called something like
  fontforge_full-20060817.tar.bz2.--></p>

    <p>After you have downloaded one of these packages, either copy
    the tarball to where you are, or move to the directory
    containing the tarball (I can't provide explicit instructions
    here, because I don't know where your browser put the file) and
    type (do not type "$"):</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>bunzip2 FontForge.pot.bz2
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Then edit the file <code>FontForge.pot</code>.</p>

    <h4>from the <a name="src-git" id="src-git">git</a>
    repository</h4>

    <p>This is a better solution because it gives you a current
    version of the pot file. Create a git repository as described
    in the <a href="source-build.html#src-git">section on building
    from source</a>. Having done that type</p>

    <blockquote>

    <h2>Creating and <a name="Modifying" id=
    "Modifying">Modifying</a> a "po" file</h2>

    <p>You should now have a FontForge.pot file (if you don't see
    the <a href="uitranslationnotes.html#Obtaining">above
    section</a> on how to get one).</p>

    <p>The pot file is in the same format as the "po" file which
    you need to generate. Simply rename FontForge.pot to the
    language/locale that you are working on. In most cases you will
    probably want to rename it just to the language</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>mv FontForge.pot <span class=
"c3">fr</span>.po
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>But sometimes that will not be enough. For example,
    Traditional and simplified chinese are sufficiently different
    that a locale must also be specified:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>mv FontForge.pot <span class=
"c3">zh_TW</span>.po
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Once you have created your po file it is time to start
    modifying it. I shall use French as an example in the following
    (because I almost speak French), obviously you will need to
    make changes appropriate for your language.</p>

    <p>The po file begins with some lines like:</p>

    <blockquote>

    </blockquote>

    <p>Most of these are pretty self-explanatory. Fill in your name
    and email address where appropriate, and the date on which you
    last worked on the file. The plurals line is a little more
    complex, and I'll describe it <a href=
    "uitranslationnotes.html#plurals">later</a>.</p>

    <p>Next there are thousands of string entries. They look
    something like this:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
#: ttfinstrs.c:2184 typofeatures.c:1450 ../gdraw/gaskdlg.c:1076
#: ../gdraw/gaskdlg.c:1332 ../gdraw/gaskdlg.c:1391 ../gdraw/gfiledlg.c:152
#: ../gdraw/gmatrixedit.c:711 ../gdraw/gsavefiledlg.c:280
msgid "_Cancel"
msgstr ""
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>You should change these to:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
#: ttfinstrs.c:2184 typofeatures.c:1450 ../gdraw/gaskdlg.c:1076
#: ../gdraw/gaskdlg.c:1332 ../gdraw/gaskdlg.c:1391 ../gdraw/gfiledlg.c:152
#: ../gdraw/gmatrixedit.c:711 ../gdraw/gsavefiledlg.c:280
msgid "_Cancel"
msgstr "<span class="c3">_Annuler</span>"
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>So the translation goes into the msgstr line. (The comment
    lines above indicate in what source files and on what lines the
    "_Cancel" string is used -- this information may be helpful if
    you want more information about context). If you don't want to
    translate a string just leave the msgstr as a null-string, and
    the English text will be used ("OK" seems to be left
    untranslated in many languages)</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
#: ttfinstrs.c:2184 typofeatures.c:1450 ../gdraw/gaskdlg.c:1076
#: ../gdraw/gaskdlg.c:1332 ../gdraw/gaskdlg.c:1391 ../gdraw/gfiledlg.c:152
#: ../gdraw/gmatrixedit.c:711 ../gdraw/gsavefiledlg.c:280
msgid "_OK"
msgstr ""
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Some strings contain mnemonics. The mnemonic is preceded by
    an underscore.</p>

    <p>That seems fairly straight forward. But there are always
    complications. Sometimes an English word might be translated by
    different French words depending on context. For example in
    French the English word "New" might be translated as either
    "Nouveau" or "Nouvelle" depending on the gender of the thing
    being created. In Japanese the word for the latin language is
    different from the latin script. So to disambiguate some
    strings a little bit of context information may appear before
    the actual string to be translated:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
msgid "File|_New"
msgstr "<span class="c3">_Nouveau</span>"
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>or</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
msgid "Anchor|_New"
msgstr "<span class="c3">_Nouvelle</span>"
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The context will be any text before an "|". It should not be
    translated. Indeed both it and the "|" should be completely
    omitted.</p>

    <p>Finally we have the problem of <a name="plurals" id=
    "plurals">plurals</a>. Suppose we have a string</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
msgid "%d Group"
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>We need to inflect the word "Group" depending on the number
    of groups we've got -- and each language has different
    rules.</p>

    <p>Remember, at the beginning of the file there was a line:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
"Plural-Forms: nplurals=<span class=
"c3">2</span>; plural=<span class="c3">n&gt;1</span>;\n"
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This says that this language has two plural forms, the
    singular form is used when there are 0 or 1 entries (n&lt;=1),
    and the plural form is used for n&gt;1 entries. That rule is
    correct for French. English looks like:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
"Plural-Forms: nplurals=<span class=
"c3">2</span>; plural=<span class="c3">n!=1</span>;\n"
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>A language like classical Greek, which has a dual form,
    might look like</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
"Plural-Forms: nplurals=<span class=
"c3">3</span>; plural=<span class=
"c3">n&lt;=1?0:n==2?1:2</span>;\n"
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The expression is a c language expression. When there is a
    string that might be plural it has a slightly different form in
    the po file</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
#: groups.c:1558
msgid "%d Group"
msgid_plural "%d Groups"
msgstr[0] "<span class="c3">%d Groupe</span>"
msgstr[1] "<span class="c3">%d Groupes</span>"
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Obviously, in a language with three forms there would be
    additional <code>msgstr[n]</code> entries.</p>

    <h2><a name="Updating" id="Updating">Updating</a> an already
    existing "po" file</h2>

    <p>After a few months, you will probably find that I've added
    some additional strings to FontForge, and you may want to
    update your original po file.</p>

    <p>Once again you <a href=
    "uitranslationnotes.html#Obtaining">grab a current "pot"
    file</a> and you type:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>msgmerge <span class=
"c3">fr</span>.po FontForge.pot &gt;<span class=
"c3">fr</span>-new.po
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This will update your po file to contain any new strings for
    you to translate. It will also make guesses for these new
    strings. Some of these guesses are correct, some are very
    strange, so you will want to examine the guessed strings (they
    will be marked with the word "fuzzy" -- emacs has a mode that
    makes checking these easy).</p>

    <h2><a name="Testing" id="Testing">Testing</a> a "po" file</h2>

    <p>Once you have completed your po file you will want to test
    it.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>If you have a copy of the fontforge source distribution
      you can test it by

        <ul>
          <li>copying your new file into the fontforge/po
          directory:

            <blockquote>
              <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>cp <span class=
"c3">fr</span>.po fontforge-20060819/fontforge/po
</pre>
            </blockquote>
          </li>

          <li>Reconfiguring fontforge, and installing it

            <blockquote>
              <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>cd fontforge-20060819
<span class="c2">$ </span>./configure
<span class="c2">$ </span>make
<span class="c2">$ </span>su
<span class="c2"># </span>make install
</pre>
            </blockquote>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Or, if you want to do things manually:

        <ul>
          <li>First you need to compile it:

            <blockquote>
              <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>msgfmt -o <span class=
"c3">fr</span>.mo <span class="c3">fr</span>.po
</pre>
            </blockquote>

            <p>and create an "mo" file.</p>
          </li>

          <li>This file you will want to rename and move to the
          appropriate directory. If fontforge is installed in
          /usr/local/bin then you would say

            <blockquote>
              <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>mv <span class=
"c3">fr</span>.mo /usr/local/share/locale/<span class=
"c3">fr</span>/LC_MESSAGES/FontForge.mo
</pre>
            </blockquote>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Then make sure your locale is set properly (and that your
    operating system has the support files it needs for that
    locale) and start fontforge. You should see your
    translation</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>LANG=<span class=
"c3">fr_FR.UTF-8</span>; export LANG
<span class="c2">$ </span>fontforge -new
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Still <a name="More" id="More">more</a> strings to
    translate!</h2>

    <p>FontForge has some strings that do not fit into the standard
    gettext mechanism. These are strings for which fontforge wants
    to know all translations at all times. For exampe the truetype
    'name' table encourages designers to provide a translation for
    the stylistic variant of the font into as many languages as
    possible. So if you had a Bold font it would be nice if the
    'name' table contained: An English entry, "Bold"; A French
    entry, "Gras"; A German entry, "Fett". To make this easier on
    the designer FontForge would like to have all translations of
    "Bold" built into it at all times, all translations of
    "Italic", "Condensed", and so forth.</p>

    <p><a href="fontstyles.html">There is a table of the stylistic
    names FontForge recognizes on the Font Info page.</a></p>

    <p>There is a second list of names for which FontForge would
    like multiple translations because these also appear in the
    'name' table translated into as many languages as possible.
    These are the names of the mac's Feature/Setting strings, and
    they may be found on <a href=
    "http://developer.apple.com/fonts/Registry/index.html">Apple's
    Font Feature registry</a>.</p>

    <p>Finally I would like to make it as easy as possible to embed
    the <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/OFL">OFL</a> into a font
    created by FontForge, and I would like to encourage its
    translation (And that of its accompanying FAQ) into as many
    languages as possible.</p>

    <p>SIL regards translation as important but adds the following
    caveats (in their <a href=
    "http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;item_id=OFL-FAQ_web">
    FAQ</a>):</p>

    <blockquote>
      <b>5.5 How about translating the license and the FAQ into
      other languages?</b>

      <p>SIL certainly recognises the need for people who are not
      familiar with English to be able to understand the OFL and
      this FAQ better in their own language. Making the license
      very clear and readable is a key goal of the OFL.</p>

      <p>If you are an experienced translator, you are very welcome
      to help translating the OFL and its FAQ so that designers and
      users in your language community can understand the license
      better. But only the original English version of the license
      has legal value and has been approved by the community.
      Translations do not count as legal substitutes and should
      only serve as a way to explain the original license. SIL - as
      the author and steward of the license for the community at
      large - does not approve any translation of the OFL as
      legally valid because even small translations ambiguities
      could be abused and create problems.</p>

      <p>We give permission to publish unofficial translations into
      other languages provided that they comply with the following
      guidelines:</p>

      <p>- put the following disclaimer in both English and the
      target language stating clearly that the translation is
      unofficial:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "This is an unofficial translation of the SIL Open Font
        License into $language. It was not published by SIL
        International, and does not legally state the distribution
        terms for fonts that use the OFL. A release under the OFL
        is only valid when using the original English text.

        <p>However, we recognize that this unofficial translation
        will help users and designers not familiar with English to
        understand the SIL OFL better and make it easier to use and

    <h2>Changing the assignment of <a name="HotKeys" id=
    "HotKeys">Hot Keys</a></h2>

    <p>FontForge has a <a href="HotKeys.html">default assignment of
    hot key</a> (menu shortcuts, whatever term you wish to use).
    This assignment can be difficult to use on non-English
    keyboards. Even users with English keyboards might find reasons
    to disagree with it. So FontForge allows you to redefine the
    hot keys. This is done using a gettext mechanism, but in a
    different pot file from the normal set of translation strings
    (which means it uses a different gettext "text domain").</p>

    <p>The hot key pot file is called:
    <tt>FontForge-MenuShortCuts.pot</tt></p>

    <p>(This can also be obtained <a href=
    "FontForge-MenuShortCuts.pot.bz2">from the website</a>, or
    generated from the git repository)</p>

    <p>On the Mac, FontForge allows for two different key bindings.
    X11 can be configured to pass the command key on to FontForge,
    or X11 may use the command key in its own menubar. If FontForge
    doesn't get the command key then it will do normal processing
    using normal keybindings. Otherwise FontForge will first look
    for a file called Mac-FontForge-MenuShortCuts.po if this is
    found (and if it rebinds the string "Flag0x10+" (which should
    become "Cmd+" -- or whatever is appropriate in your language))
    then it will be used. Otherwise it falls back to normal
    processing.</p>

    <p>This file consists of a sequence of entries that look
    like:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
#: bitmapview.c:1720 charview.c:7833 charview.c:9079 fontview.c:6521
msgid "New|Ctl+N"
msgstr ""

#: bitmapview.c:1721 charview.c:7834 charview.c:9080 fontview.c:6525
msgid "Open|Ctl+O"
msgstr ""

#: bitmapview.c:1723 charview.c:7836 charview.c:9082 fontview.c:6527
msgid "Close|Ctl+Shft+Q"
msgstr ""

#: bitmapview.c:1729 charview.c:7842
msgid "Export...|No Shortcut"
msgstr ""

#: fontview.c:7798
msgid "Help|F1"
msgstr ""
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Each entry (msgid) is formatted as follows</p>

    <ul>
      <li>First is the command name as it appears in the (English)
      menu.</li>

      <li>Then there is the special character "|" which separates
      the command name from the hot key specification.</li>

      <li>Then a list of key modifiers separated by "+"</li>

      <li>And finally the key itself</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So in the first example above <code>New|Ctl+N</code> means
    that this is the hot key for the New command, and that the
    default definition of that hot key is Control N.</p>

    <p>Modifier lists can be more complex
    <code>Close|Ctl+Shft+Q</code> means that the hot key for the
    Close command is Control Shift Q.</p>

    <p>Not all commands have hot keys in the default assignment,
    but since some users might want to assign keys to them they
    still have entries. Thus <code>Export...|No Shortcut</code>
    means that the Export command has no shortcut (no hot key) in
    English.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to use keys with no modifiers. Generally
    you will not want to do that for a normal, alphabetic key, but
    for special keys, like the function keys, it is perfectly
    acceptable. <code>Help|F1</code> means that the Help command is
    bound to the first function key.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>So that's what the msgid field means. The above information
    describes the default key bindings. You want to know how to
    change them. The format is almost the same (the only exception
    is that you will not include the command name nor the "|"
    separator), but you need to change the msgstr field.</p>

    <p>Suppose that you wanted to remove the shortcut for the open
    command, and add one to the Export command: You might create a
    po file which looks like:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
#: #: bitmapview.c:1721 charview.c:7834 charview.c:9080 fontview.c:6525
msgid "Open|Ctl+O"
msgstr "No Shortcut"

#: bitmapview.c:1729 charview.c:7842
msgid "Export...|No Shortcut"
msgstr "Alt+Cntl+Shft+E"
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>NOTE: <span class="c3"><strong>Omitting a string will not
    remove the shortcut</strong></span>. Instead FontForge will use
    the default shortcut. If you want to remove a shortcut you must
    add an explicit assignment to "<code>No Shortcut</code>".</p>

    <p>FontForge recognizes the following standard modifiers:
    <code>Alt+, Ctl+, Shft+, CapsLock+, Opt+</code> (the last
    corresponds to the Option key on the mac keyboard,
    <code>Cmd+</code> for the mac Command key <span class=
    "c3"><strong>Note:</strong></span> This can only be used by an
    X program if the X11 application does not appropriate it --
    this can be configured in the X11 Preferences).</p>

    <p>Some keyboards have additional modifier keys, X maps them to
    a flag bit in the keyboard state mask of the XKeyEvent. If you
    want to use these modifiers you need to know what that bit is.
    FontForge will also recognize:<br />
    <code>Flag0x01+, Flag0x02+, Flag0x04+, Flag0x08+,<br />
    Flag0x10+, Flag0x20+, Flag0x40+, Flag0x80+</code></p>

    <p>The hot key itself should be entered in UTF-8.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>There are a few other strings in this file.</p>

    <p>When FF displays a shortcut in the menu it will use a
    similar syntax.<br />
    That may not be appropriate for non-English terminals. On a
    French system it might be better to show the Shift modifier as
    <i>Majuscule</i>. At the bottom of this file are several
    entries which are not used to set shortcuts but are used in
    displaying the shortcuts in the menu, thus</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
#: ../gdraw/gmenu.c:120
msgid "Shft+"
msgstr "Maj+"
msgid "Flag0x80+"
msgstr "AltGr+"
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>(These changes only affect what FontForge <em>displays</em>
    in the menu. If you try to specify a keybinding as <code>msgstr
    "Ctl+Maj+E"</code> it will <span class=
    "c3"><strong>NOT</strong></span> work)</p>

    <p>Even though not obvious from this file, it is also possible
    to add names for special keys. So you could add:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
msgid "Escape"
msgstr "Échappe"
msgid "Delete"
msgstr "Efface"
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The English names accepted for special keys are those
    defined under XK_MISCELLANY in keysymdef.h of the X11 header
    files -- without the initial XK_</p>
    <hr />

    <p>You can obtain a <code>FontForge-MenuShortCuts.pot</code>
    file in pretty much the same way you <a href=
    "uitranslationnotes.html#Obtaining">obtain a
    <code>FontForge.pot</code> file</a> -- download the source and
    then type:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>cd fontforge/fontforge
<span class=
"c2">$ </span>make -f Makefile.in FontForge-MenuShortCuts.pot
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Again you will want to <a href=
    "uitranslationnotes.html#Modifying">rename this file before
    working on it</a>:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<span class=
"c2">$ </span>mv FontForge-MenuShortCuts.pot fr-MenuShortCuts.po
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Then edit the file to insert your short cuts.</p>

    <p>If you want to install your new short cuts:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>First you need to compile it:

        <blockquote>
          <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>msgfmt -o <span class=
"c3">fr-MenuShortCuts</span>.mo <span class=
"c3">fr-MenuShortCuts</span>.po
</pre>
        </blockquote>

        <p>and create an "mo" file.</p>
      </li>

      <li>This file you will want to rename and move to the
      appropriate directory. If fontforge is installed in
      /usr/local/bin then you would say

        <blockquote>
          <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>mv <span class=
"c3">fr-MenuShortCuts</span>.mo /usr/local/share/locale/<span class="c3">fr</span>/LC_MESSAGES/FontForge-MenuShortCuts.mo
</pre>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The above example assumes you have FontForge installed
        in <code>/usr/local</code>. If you installed it elsewhere
        (<code>/usr</code> for instance) simply replace
        <code>/usr/local/share</code> with <code>/usr/share</code>,
        or whatever is appropriate.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Currently there are no examples of these files, and there is
    nothing in the Makefile to install them.</p>

    <p>Creating a Mac file is similar. There is one example of this
    in the git repository under <code>po/mackeys/en.po</code>. It
    should be the same as the default key bindings except that the
    Control key has been replaced everywhere with the Command key.
    You can install it</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<span class="c2">$ </span>mv <span class=
"c3">en</span>.mo /usr/local/share/locale/<span class=
"c3">en</span>/LC_MESSAGES/Mac-FontForge-MenuShortCuts.mo
</pre>
