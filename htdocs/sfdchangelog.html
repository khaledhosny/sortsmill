    to the sfd format</h1>

    <p>FontForge's <a href="sfdformat.html">sfd (spline font
    database) format</a> changes over time as fontforge supports
    more things. I have only recently started keeping track of
    these changes, so older changes are not listed here.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>14-Sep-2010

        <ul>
          <li>Added gasp table version to GaspTable keyword.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>03-Feb-2010

        <ul>
          <li>Added woff keywords (woffMajor, woffMinor (for
          version #) and woffMetadata for unparsed xml
          metadata).</li>

          <li>Added sfntRevision keyword</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>22-Oct-2009

        <ul>
          <li>Add WidthSeparation keyword</li>

          <li>Add extension to subtable specification to handle
          storing default separation,min kerning and touching
          values of the subtable in the sfd</li>

          <li>Hmm. Document how vertical kerning subtables are
          indicated</li>

          <li>Hmm. Document how default prefixes for single
          substitution subtables are stored.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>12-May-2009

        <ul>
          <li>Add MarkAttachmentSet entries</li>

          <li>Add names for features 'ss01'-'ss20'</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>15-Mar-2009

        <ul>
          <li>Add a BDFRefChar keyword to support bitmap references
          (Alexey Kryukov)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>5-Mar-2009

        <ul>
          <li>Add support for the JSTF table in sfd.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>12-Nov-2008

        <ul>
          <li>Add a field to the font: ExtremaBound. Any spline
          where the distance between its end points is less than or
          equal to this will not be checked for extrema.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>22-Aug-2008

        <ul>
          <li>Add a flag to the Layer keyword (in the font) to say
          whether the layer is a background layer or not. As the
          flag is at the end of the line, previous versions of
          fontforge will just ignore it</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>10-July-2008

        <ul>
          <li>Extend the image output format to support
          red/green/blue/alpha images. (not much of an extension --
          there's just more data)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>26-May-2008

        <ul>
          <li>Adobe says UniqueID and XUID are deprecated. Add
          flags (UseXUID/UseUniqueID) to indicate we still want to
          include them in fonts in spite of that.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>30-Mar-2008

        <ul>
          <li>Bump the sfd version number to 3. This is a bit late,
          but better late than never. It should have happened with
          the Layers release on 2-Mar.</li>

          <li>Support for BASE table, new keywords

            <ul>
              <li>BaseHoriz</li>

              <li>BaseVert</li>

              <li>BaseScript</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This also involved removing the old vertical origin
            keyword which is (I hope) a subset of the BASEline
            information.</p>
          </li>

          <li>Support for Gradient and Pattern Fills in Type3
          fonts, new keywords

            <ul>
              <li>FillGradient</li>

              <li>StrokeGradient</li>

              <li>FillPattern</li>

              <li>StrokePattern</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Added support for clipping paths in Type3 fonts, new
          keyword

            <ul>
              <li>PathFlags</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>2-Mar-2008

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b><big>Layers</big></b><br />
            <span class="c2">This turned out to be a change which
            was backwards incompatible. I did not realize that at
            the time</span>

            <p>All fonts may now have multiple layers (before only
            Type3 fonts could). The Type3 format has not changed so
            the discussion that follows concentrates on normal
            fonts and should be understood not to refer to type3
            fonts.</p>

            <p>All glyphs in a given (non-type3) font have the same
            number of layers so there is a LayerCount keyword in
            the font which provides that (there is also a
            LayerCount keyword now in each glyph. This provides
            redundant information, it should be the same as the
            font's layer count (for non type3 fonts).</p>

            <p>Before this the foreground and background and Guide
            layers all had the same spline type (quadratic or
            cubic), now that can vary from layer to layer. There is
            a font level keyword "Layer" which provides the spline
            order and name of each layer. The old "Order2" keyword
            has been removed.</p>

            <p>Previously only the foreground layer of a glyph
            could contain references, now any layer can. Before the
            "Refer" keyword could appear with no layer name
            preceding it (as this unambiguously meant that the
            references would go into the foreground layer), now
            there must be a layer name preceding a "Refer"
            keyword.</p>

            <p>Each layer output is preceded by one of "Fore",
            "Back" or "Layer: d" (where "d" is the layer
            number).</p>

            <p>Before the SplineSet keyword was not needed (and was
            usually omitted) after a "Fore" or "Back" layer name.
            It is now required, and this seems to render new sfd
            files incompatible with old.</p>

            <p>(If there is no layer tag before a Refer keyword
            then the parser will apply it to the foreground
            layer)</p>

            <p>Previously the validation status applied only to the
            foreground layer. Now every layer can have its own
            status, so again the "Validated" keyword must now be
            tagged with a layer.</p>

            <p>There is a font level keyword "DisplayFont" which
            indicates what layer should be displayed in the font
            view by default.</p>

            <p>There is a font level keyword "GridOrder2" which may
            appear before the "Grid" layer name in the font to set
            the spline order of the guideline semi-layer.</p>
          </li>

      </li>

      <li>3-Feb-2008

        <ul>
          <li>The point flags bitmap in a SplineSet has been
          extended by<br />
          0x200 -- Any extrema on the preceding spline are marked
          as acceptable to the validator</li>

          <li>Some sfnt tables are now output in text instead of
          binary.

            <ul>
              <li>cvt,maxp -- output as decimal numbers (with
              possibly with comments for cvt)</li>

              <li>prep,fpgm -- output as ASCII instructions</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Get diagonal hints working again</li>

          <li>Add a FontLog field</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>9-Nov-2007

        <ul>
          <li>Add support for Raph Levien's spiro curves.</li>

          <li>Add the ability to name contours</li>
        </ul>
