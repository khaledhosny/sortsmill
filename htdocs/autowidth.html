    <p>The Auto Width command will attempt to guess reasonable
    widths (more accurately reasonable left and right side
    bearings) for your font. The command splits the selection into
    scripts and looks at all possible combinations of selected
    glyphs within each script.</p>

    <p>The Separation text box allows you to say how close you want
    the glyphs to be. If you look at a vertical bar (or sanserif
    "I"), and you autowidth it the sum of the left and right side
    bearings will be equal to the spacing. The min and max values
    will prevent sidebearings from becoming unrealistically large
    (these rarely matter).</p>

    <p>Adjusting the left and right bearings of a letter will also
    adjust the left and right bearings of all accented letters
    based (by reference) on it. You should not try to use AutoWidth
    on accented letters directly (unless those glyphs do not use
    references).<br clear="right" /></p>

    Kern</a></h2>

    <p>There used to be an Auto Kern dialog. There is no longer,
    this is now done in the <a href="lookups.html#Pair">kerning
    subtable</a> dialog and the <a href=
    "metricsview.html#kernclass">kerning class</a> dialog.</p>

    <h3>The python <code><a name="GlyphSeparationHook" id=
    "GlyphSeparationHook">GlyphSeparationHook</a></code></h3>

    <p>When FontForge does AutoKerning (and in a more complicated
    fashion, when it does AutoWidthing) it tries to guess the
    optical separation between two glyphs, and then it applies an
    appropriate kern value to make the optical separation be the
    desired spacing.</p>

    <p>FontForge assumes that the optical spacing is linear (so if
    you increase the separation between two glyphs by 3 em-units,
    then the optical spacing will also increase by 3 em-units).</p>

    <p>FF guesses the optical separation between two glyphs by
    figuring a value for the separation of two glyphs when their
    bounding boxes are adjacent. For two rectangles (where the
    bounding box is the same as the glyph itself) the separation
    will be 0 as the two glyphs will be touching. For a combination
    like "To" the optical separation will be quite large.</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="2" align="center">

    <p>The GlyphSeparationHook is a python routine which will be
    called with a bunch of information about two glyphs, and is
    expected to return an integer representing the optical
    separation between the two. It is a low-level routine; the
    actual calculation of kerning offsets or setting glyph widths
    is done elsewhere, but this routine provides the information
    those higher level routines need. Of course, if you don't
    provide a routine, FontForge has a built-in routine which will
    provide a default behavior. Here is a python version of that
    default routine:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
import fontforge;

def GlyphSeparation(onLeft,onRight,context) :
    # the goal is to give a weighted average that expresses the visual 
    #  separation between two glyphs when they are placed so their bounding 
    #  boxes are adjacent. The separation between two rectangles would be 0 
    #  While the separation between "T" and "o" would be fairly large 
    # The trick is to guess a good weighting function. My guess is that 
    #  things that look close are more important than those which look far 
    #  So "T" and "O" should be dominated by the crossbar of the "T"...
    #
    # Find the area the two glyphs have in common (so when comparing "o" and
    #  "l" or "g", ignore the ascenders and descenders since that's outside
    #  the range of "o" and won't affect its visual proximity.
    imin_y = max(onRight.iminY,onLeft.iminY);
    imax_y = min(onRight.imaxY,onLeft.imaxY);
    #
    # Some glyph combinations will have no overlap -- the grave accent and the
    # letter "a" will have none. So they don't interact visually.
    if imax_y &lt; imin_y :
        return( 0 )
    #
    # Otherwise compute some sort of weighted average of the separations between
    # the two glyphs at various heights.
    tot,cnt = 0,0
    j = imin_y
    while j&lt;=imax_y :
        if onRight.left[j] &lt; 32767 and onLeft.right[j] &gt; -32767 :
            # beware of gaps such as those in "i" or "aaccute" 
            # a gap has a left or right value which is huge
            # so ignore any such, again it doesn't contribute to the
            # visual separation.
            sep = onRight.left[j] - onLeft.right[j]
            weight = 1.0/(sep + context.denom)
            weight *= weight
            tot += weight*sep
            cnt += weight
        j += 1
    if cnt!=0 :
        tot /= cnt
    return( int(round( tot )) );

fontforge.registerGlyphSeparationHook(GlyphSeparation)
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The hook will be called with three arguments, a structure
    with information about the glyph on the left, a structure with
    information about the glyph on the right, and a structure
    containing general information about the operation as a
    whole.</p>

    <p>The context argument contains the following fields:</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="2">
      <tr>
        <td>font</td>

        <td>The font being worked on</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>emSize</td>

        <td>The emsize of the font</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>layer</td>

        <td>The active layer for this operation</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>regionHeight</td>

        <td>(explained below) by default emSize/100</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>denom</td>

        <td>1/50th of the emSize. A number I found handy.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>FontForge preprocess all the glyphs, extracting pertinant
    information from each and storing it in a separate per-glyph
    structure than the normal python Glyph object. The most
    important information is a representation of the leftmost and
    rightmost edges of the glyph. Basically, for every value of y,
    FontForge finds the smallest x coordinate on any of the glyph's
    contours at that height and stores that information in an
    array. There is a similar array containing the largest x
    coordinates. Of course there are an infinite number of y
    values, so that isn't quite accurate. FontForge divides the
    vertical axis into many regions, each regionHeight high (this
    is usually 1/100th of the emsize). It then finds the smallest x
    coordinate achieved by any contour within that region.</p>

    <p>The value stored in the array representing the leftmost edge
    of the glyph is not quite the smallest x coordinate. Instead we
    normalize the numbers so that the x coordinate of the left side
    bearing of the glyph is 0. None of the numbers in the left
    array will be negative.</p>

    <p>Similarly the value stored in the rightmost array is
    normalized so that the glyph's right side bearing is 0. None of
    the numbers in the right array will be positive.</p>

    <p>There can be gaps in a glyph -- for example in a lower case
    "i" there is a hole in the body of the glyph between the dot on
    top and the rest down below. In this case the left array will
    hold the special value 32767, and the right array will hold
    -32767.</p>

    <p>So I don't pass a standard glyph object. The underlying
    glyph object can be obtained through the <code>glyph</code>
    member. The most important things in this structure are the
    arrays representing the left and right contours called
    <code>left</code> and <code>right</code>. The structure also
    contains the upper and lower bounds of the arrays (both arrays
    have the same bounds). The glyph structures contain the
    following members:</p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="2">
      <tr>
        <td>glyph</td>

        <td>This is the standard python glyph object. This can
        (rarely) be None.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>boundingbox</td>

        <td>A tuple of 4 values (minx,miny,maxx,maxy) for the
        glyph</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>iminY</td>

        <td>The low bound of the arrays.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>imaxY</td>

        <td>The high bound of the arrays</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>left</td>

        <td>an array of integers representing the separation
        between the left edge of the bounding box and the leftmost
        contour at that height (never negative)</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>right</td>

        <td>an array of integers representing the separation
        between the right edge of the bounding box and the
        rightmost contour at that height (never positive)</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p><code>iminY</code> and <code>imaxY</code> are scaled by
    <code>regionHeight</code> from the y units in the glyph itself.
    The value contain at left[0] would represent minimum separation
    between boundingbox.minx and any the x location of any contour
    when the y location was between 0 and regionHeight. Similarly
    left[1] would be the minimum separation with the y location
    between regionHeight and 2*regionHeight. And so forth.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
    imin_y = max(onRight.iminY,onLeft.iminY);
    imax_y = min(onRight.imaxY,onLeft.imaxY);
    if imax_y &lt; imin_y :
        return( 0 )
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Here we figure out the range along the y axis where the
    glyphs both exist. If the two glyphs don't share any area along
    the y axis (as, for example, the glyph "a" and the grave accent
    might not) then we assume they do not interact and return a
    visual separation of 0.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
    tot,cnt = 0,0
    j = imin_y
    while j&lt;=imax_y :
        if onRight.left[j] &lt; 32767 and onLeft.right[j] &gt; -32767 :
            sep = onRight.left[j] - onLeft.right[j]
            weight = 1.0/(sep + context.denom)
            weight *= weight
            tot += weight*sep
            cnt += weight
        j += 1
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Otherwise loop over the y range where both glyphs are
    active. Checking to make sure there are no holes.</p>

    <p>We find the actual separation between the two glyphs at this
    y value.</p>

    <p>Then we calculate some magic weighting function (this is
    handwaving. your routine will have a better weighting
    function)</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
    if cnt!=0 :
        tot /= cnt
    return( int(round( tot )) );
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>And finally we take the weighted average of those
    separations, and return that as the optical separation.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre>
fontforge.registerGlyphSeparationHook(GlyphSeparation)
</pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>And this routine will tell FontForge to use the hook you
    provide.</p>
