    <ul>
      <li>Git HEAD

        <ul>
          <li><b>General:</b></li>

          <li>Fix bug that caused incorrectly dumping some context
          substitution format 1 lookups to feature files. We were
          also accepting the broken lookups we were generated and
          FontForge would crash later, now they are rejected,
          too.</li>

          <li>"TeX Names" is now accepted internally as an alias
          for "ΤεΧ Names" when specifying a name list by name.</li>

          <li>Typo in hhead generation code caused descent offset
          setting to be ignored and the ascent offset setting to be
          used instead.</li>

          <li>A new glyph name list based Adobe Glyph List For New
          Fonts, it is now the default when creating new
          fonts.</li>

          <li>No longer warns about using the names Omega, Delta
          and mu for ohm, increment and mu, respectively. Adobe
          fixed the names to point to the Greek letters, then later
          changed their mind and reverted back to the old names, so
          now we do the same.</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash in EPS import.</li>

          <li>FontForge is internally using doubles by default now,
          but can be still configured to use floats. Support for
          log doubles have been removed.</li>

          <li>Thanks to Lu Wang, fonts can now be loaded from PDF
          files using <code>filename(fontname)</code> notation from
          command line too.</li>

          <li>Increase the limit of entries read from encoding
          files to 65536 instead of 1024.</li>

          <li>Support for v1.6 feature file syntax for mark classes
          have been dropped, v1.8 syntax should be always
          used.</li>

          <li><b>UI fixes and additions:</b></li>

          <li>It is now possible to style vertical tabset layout
          differently than horizontal by means of dummy GGadget
          <code>GVTabSet</code>.</li>

          <li>Type3/multilayer, device tables and the paste after
          command are always enabled now.</li>

          <li>Cairo is now used for drawing all windows (when
          enabled) which improves the rendering overall.</li>

          <li>Char view palettes are now docked by default.</li>

          <li>A default resource file will be loaded at startup
          from
          <code>$prefix/share/fontforge/resources/fontforge.resource</code>.</li>

          <li>There is now a possibility to have a quick preview in
          glyph window by holding [`] key down. This doesn't work
          if quick navigation is turned on, but can also be toggled
          with [Ctrl]+[`] shortcut.</li>

          <li>There is now an option in Generate Font dialog to
          prepend a timestamp to the font family name. This is for
          font development only ant it enables simultaneous testing
          of different font versions in production
          environment.</li>

          <li>Improved translation coverage for error
          messages.</li>

          <li>Improved rendering of GTabSet.</li>

          <li>Fixed mnemonics clash (<i><span class=
          "c5">N</span>ext</i> &amp; <i>Glyph <span class=
          "c5">N</span>ame</i>) in glyph info dialog.</li>

          <li>Fixed mnemonics in contextual menu of layers palette
          and in problem detector.</li>

          <li>New and updated translations:

            <ul>
              <li>Updated Polish translation from Michał
              Nowakowski.</li>

              <li>Updated Russian translation from Alexandre
              Proukodine.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li><b>Python scripting fixes and additions:</b></li>

          <li>Thanks to Lu Wang, <code>LoadEncodingFile</code> now
          takes an optional encoding name parameter that is useful
          for loading Unicode consortium format encoding files,
          which were just ignored before.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>31-Jul-2012

        <ul>
          <li><b>General:</b></li>

          <li>Thanks to Matthew Petroff, we have now a binary
          package for MS/Windows available.</li>

          <li>Thanks to Jose Da Silva, Unicode utils are now
          partially sanitized (which means less possible buffer
          overruns and memory allocation failures) and better
          documented.</li>

          <li>FontForge now takes x-www-browser, Google Chrome and
          Konqueror into account when trying to open help
          pages.</li>

          <li>Improved compatibility with UFO workflow with Robofab
          based apps by preserving letter cases in *.glif
          names.</li>

          <li>Fixed some crashes on X resource loading and saving
          that occurred because of bad image path or pixmap
          directory.</li>

          <li>Georg Duffner reported and helped to isolate a bug in
          parsing OS/2 Version in Font Info in case the string
          "Automatic" was not localised.</li>

          <li>Configure works on mac again.</li>

          <li>Fixed compilation with XCode 4.3 on Max OS X
          Lion.</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash for fonts with kerning entries
          containing negative values.</li>

          <li>Patch by Sourceforge user serval2412 to fix some
          resource leaks.</li>

          <li>Patch by Khaled Hosny for calculating wrong x and cap
          height for some fonts. If glyphs checked don't have flat
          surfaces at the top, FontForge takes the mean. But it was
          dividing by the wrong value.</li>

          <li>FontForge didn't build on some systems where /bin/sh
          is synonymous with dash, yet the usual user shell is
          bash. Configure and libtool were thus using different
          shells, that turned out to be incompatible. Luigi Scarso
          suggested patching the makefiles with explicitly setting
          the SHELL variable.</li>

          <li>Path by Steve White to enable support for ASMO 708
          codepage.</li>

          <li><a href=
          "http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=4F37E48C.4020508%40newtypography.co.uk&amp;forum_name=fontforge-devel">
          We needed to go back to old implementation of the fsType
          table.</a></li>

          <li>Patch by Michael Terry to fix crashes for pngs having
          NULL for trans_alpha;</li>

          <li>Patches by Daniel Kahn Gillmor and Paul Flo Williams
          to add support for libpng 1.5.</li>

          <li>The names 'alefmaksurainitialarabic' and
          'alefmaksuramedialarabic' in the Adobe Glyph List
          disagree with Unicode. The use of these glyph names is
          therefore discouraged. Patch by Steve White.</li>

          <li>Encoding ID should be set to 10 for fonts containing
          unicode characters outside of BMP. Patch by Steve
          White.</li>

          <li>Hunh. We aren't adding libintl to the library list
          when we find out that we need it.</li>

          <li>Patch from Johan Winge to fix outputting of 24-bit
          BMP images.</li>

          <li>Patch from Maxim Iorsh to fix a crash for very long
          lines in UI. Specifically, crash occurs when putting a
          very long list of glyphs (~300 characters) in chaining
          substitution dialog.</li>

          <li>Patch by Pierre Hanser to fix a segfault in
          validation code when there was an empty line in PS
          private dictionary.</li>

          <li>Patch from Paul Flo Williams to Fedora bug 694986.
          See
          https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=694986</li>

          <li>Patch by Khaled Hosny to fix a crash when cancelling
          a warning about glyph name or encoding already being in
          use.</li>

          <li>Patch from Matthew Skala to fix PS "Stack got too
          big" error.</li>

          <li>Matthew Skala pointed out, that featurefile.c line 94
          tests the pointer sc for being null *after* dereferencing
          it, thus segfaulting if it does happen to be null.</li>

          <li>Patch from Steve White, to fix various issues in the
          Unicode Ranges panel in the Font Info dialog.</li>

          <li>Khaled Hosny forwarded a tweaked patch from Werner
          Fink of LuaTEX team, fixing a warning on line 400 and 401
          within ioescapestopped() of psread.c</li>

          <li>When reading a kerning class we did not check to see
          if we got back an erroneous coverage table.</li>

          <li>At some point, FF only compiled if configured for
          type3 fonts.</li>

          <li>Fixed handling PDF opacity and patterns/gradients
          behaviour with respect to the current transformation
          matrix.</li>

          <li>Kerning pairs associated with a glyph weren't
          properly reinstantiated when reverting that glyph from
          the original SFD file. This could result to crashes (e.
          g. when attempting to save the font).</li>

          <li>When displaying a pair of kerned glyphs in a tooltip
          box, FF would actually ignore the left bearing of the
          second glyph. If bearing was negative (e. g. in case of a
          combining mark) this could even result into a crash.</li>

          <li>A wrong Descender value has been written into
          generated afm files, if the font lacked typical glyphs
          with descenders.</li>

          <li>The gasp table version was ignored when writing and
          opening SFD files.</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug when loading a type3 font with
          references.</li>

          <li>Patch by Alexey Kryukov to fix a crash in matrix edit
          controls.</li>

          <li>FF wasn't reading cmap AT ALL for cid keyed
          files.</li>

          <li>FF's CID menu now allows 256 cid sub-fonts - it used
          to be 42.</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash when a context chaining lookup
          glyph-based subtable had no glyphs in the backtrack
          section.</li>

          <li>The routine which (re)calculated the line height of a
          matrix edit had a bug which caused it to look at (random
          garbage) characters after the end of a string. This often
          produced warnings about "bad utf8 string" or some
          such.</li>

          <li>Fixed handling of he symetrical smoothing flag bits
          for gasp.</li>

          <li>FontForge checks at configure to see if libintl and
          libintl.h are on the system. It did NOT check whether
          msgfmt was in the path. So if a user has installed
          macports/fink but not added the appropriate bin directory
          to their path the configure script would think all was
          well and would create a makefile for .po files.
          Unfortunately the make file would die because msgfmt
          would not run.</li>

          <li>The charview hint routines used a routine which could
          try to store 5 points in an array that only held 4. The
          resultant memory corruption could cause crashes. Patch by
          Paul Flo Williams.</li>

          <li>Fixed a crash in Expand Stroke.</li>

          <li>Fixed some bugs in deletion of mark classes and mark
          sets in font info.</li>

          <li><b>Python scripting fixes and additions:</b></li>

          <li>'altuni' member of glyph object in Python API was not
          documented.</li>

          <li>Patches by Akiro Sakigawa to fix setting and changing
          os2_unicoderanges and os2_codepages.</li>

          <li>Patch by GUST Team to fix a resource leak in python
          scripting.</li>

          <li>Patch by Khaled Hosny to fix a memory corruption
          crash in python scripting.</li>

          <li>When loading an encoding from Python, one need to
          know the name of the encoding in order to use it, so it
          makes sense for loadEncodingFile() to return that name.
          Patch by Khaled Hosny.</li>

          <li>'fontlog' and 'comment' members of font object in
          Python API were not documented. Patch by Khaled
          Hosny.</li>

          <li>Patch from Andrew Miller to make python "addLookup"
          function actually work.</li>

          <li>A patch from Khaled, fixing a memory issue in python
          interface.</li>

          <li>Assign the correct meaning to the symmetrical
          smoothing GASP flags in the Python interface.</li>

          <li>Changing the unicode value of a code point with
          python did not mark the font's encoding as changed which
          lead to subtle errors later.</li>

          <li>New python command:
          <code>font.addContextualSubtable</code></li>

          <li>Adxded a python entry to the "Change Glyph" dlg.</li>

          <li><b>Opentype Features fixes and additions, mostly by
          Khaled Hosny:</b></li>

          <li>Fixed a (probably) misplaced warning reported by
          Matthew Skala, displayed on openning an OpenType file
          with a design size and design range but no
          stylename.</li>

          <li>Optical size now gets actually included into fonts
          built.</li>

          <li>In contextual chaining substitution lookups the
          backtrack classes are ordered in reverse way, but feature
          file syntax expects them to be in natural order, as
          confirmed by Adobe. FF does this from now, but this
          breaks any feature files that expect the old, incorrect
          behaviour.</li>

          <li>Added support for feature files containing kerning
          classes with value records that can't be handled by
          classes. They will get converted into kerning pairs, like
          with AFDKO's makeotf.</li>

          <li>Changed behaviour of kerning right to left
          characters. Now it's the user who is responsible for
          specifying the kerning in the right order and for
          adjusting the right values. But this makes things
          predictable.</li>

          <li>FontForge was trying to output "pos" rules for the
          marks themselves, not base glyphs. It was also outputting
          the mark once for the base anchor (correct) and once for
          the mark anchor (wrong).</li>

          <li>FontForge will, from now, handle new, unescaped
          syntax for mark lookup tags in feature files.</li>

          <li>FontForge escaped 'mark' feature tag when exporting
          feature files. According to the specification, escaping
          is only for glyph names and CID indices.</li>

          <li>Ligature caret handling in feature files was broken;
          only first LigatureCaret declaration worked as expected,
          all subsequent ones was accumulating all previous
          ones.</li>

          <li>Sometimes GDEF definitions in feature file were being
          formatted wrongly.</li>

          <li>Fixes by Alexey Kryukov to some issues reported by
          Adam Twardoch:

            <ul>
              <li>In the 'size' feature the parameters were written
              with a locale-dependent decimal separator, while the
              decimal dotis only allowed by the spec;</li>

              <li>FF used to generate empty definitions for
              standard GDEF classes if there were no glyphs to
              assign to them, while they should have been omitted
              according to the spec. Although the class names in
              GlyphClassDef should be comma-separated, and the
              positions for omitted classes still should be
              indicated with commas.</li>

              <li>Moreover, FF would put some glyphs into wrong
              classes due to a difference between its internal
              standard class IDs and ones used in the feature file
              syntax.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Any operation which required temporary expansion of
          kerning classes (such as displaying the "Kern Pairs"
          dialog) could result into a complete loss of pairwise
          (not class based) kerning data.</li>

          <li>Eric Schrijver requested that GLIF output be more
          similar to that of RoboFab's to make diffing files
          easier.</li>

          <li>Patch by Khaled to fix a bug in ff's featurefile
          processing of UseMarkFilteringSet.</li>

          <li>If a feature contained both multiple and single
          substitutions, then FF would lose the single subs.
          Instead change the single subs to multiples.</li>

          <li><b>UI fixes and additions:</b></li>

          <li>Zvi Gilboa pointed out that for FontForge to be
          listed under "show other applications", the
          <code>exec=</code> line in .desktop file needs to be
          terminated by <code>%U</code>.</li>

          <li>Tried to improve integration with EWMH. Not
          guaranteed to work at all!</li>

          <li>Fixed handling of HV Group Box (actually GGroup) in X

          <li><img src="fftype32.png" height="32" width="32" class=
          "c6" /> New application icons by Severin Meyer.</li>

          <li>Added support for UI icons with alpha-channel. Not
          enabled for Mac, because it happens to crash on some
          builds. This is still under investigation.</li>

          <li>New new X resources for interface styling:

            <ul>
              <li><code>FontView.GlyphInfoColor</code></li>

              <li><code>FontView.EmptySlotFgColor</code></li>

              <li><code>FontView.HintingNeededColor</code></li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Fixed styling of scrollbar border. Also made possible
          a different color for thumb's bed (using depressed
          background).</li>

          <li>Widget gradients changed.</li>

          <li>Palette buttons in Glyph View, point type icons in
          Point Info dialog, icons for TTF debugger and file
          chooser are now loadable from external files, like icons
          for menu items.</li>

          <li>Fixed <code>Box.ShadowOuter</code> and
          <code>Box.Padding</code> handling in resource
          editor.</li>

          <li>New and updated translations:

            <ul>
              <li>New Catalan translation, from Rafael Ferran i
              Peralta.</li>

              <li>New Ukrainian translation from Yuri
              Chornoivan.</li>

              <li>Lee Chenhwa Simplified Chinese translation.</li>

              <li>Wei-Lun Chao updated Traditional Chinese
              translation.</li>

              <li>Michal Nowakowski updated Polish
              translation.</li>

              <li>Updated Russian translation from Alexandre
              Proukodine.</li>

              <li>Spelling Fixes by Yuri Chornoivan, Steve White
              and Michal Nowakowski.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Make message about bad anchor point more informative.
          Patch by Steve White.</li>

          <li>Allow user to customize frequency of autosaving (or
          turn off entirely).</li>

          <li>Patch from Khaled Hosny, to disable automatic setting
          "Is offset" field on in the font metrics. This confused
          users.</li>

          <li>Patch from Khaled Hosny not to set NeedsXUIDChange if
          UseXUID is not set.</li>

          <li>The CharView-&gt;Element-&gt;Order submenu did not
          enable its menu items properly if an image were
          selected.</li>

          <li>If a glyph had more than one background image then
          selecting one and scaling it would ignore the selection
          and scale all images.</li>

          <li>It was impossible to import more than one background
          image due to a typo.</li>

          <li>When closing a gradient window, ff tended to
          crash.</li>

          <li>Patch by Alexey Kryukov to make possible selecting
          control points without moving them. Later its glitch were
          fixed by George Williams.</li>

          <li>It was not possible to cut or delete bitmap
          references from bitmap view.</li>

          <li>Patch by Alexey Kryukov to center glyphs in charview
          by default (but not yet vertically).</li>

          <li>Patch by Alexey Kryukov to tweak rules on when to
          refit charview contents within window after pasting new
          content there.</li>

          <li>A few tweaks by Alexey Kryukov to metrics view.

            <ul>
              <li>If the displayed kerning value comes from a
              kerning file, assume this pair should take a
              precedence over any possible kern class entries and
              don't bother user asking what exactly (s)he wants to
              modify;</li>

              <li>If user sets a kerning offset to zero and this
              offset is defined by a kerning pair, then clean up
              that kerning pair automatically;</li>

              <li>The kerning subtable selection combo box was
              practically useless as its value was reset each time
              a glyph was selected. So first check if the selected
              subtable is relevant, and, if so, don't change
              it.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Patch by Alexey Kryukov to make it possible again to
          reorder classes and rules in the contextual substitutions
          dialog. Also the dialog was initialized with zero
          classes, but, as soon as the first class was created, FF
          was starting to treat it as an "Everything else" class,
          no matter how it was defined by user. So make sure this
          magick class is always present to avoid any
          confusion.</li>

          <li>FF will remember the last font(s) open (at the last
          quit) and reopen them on a start-up with no named fonts
          on the command line. Starting up with the flag --open
          will avoid this code.</li>

          <li>On glyph rename, all places the name is referenced
          (substitutions, etc.) are supposed to be updated. But
          glyph and coverage table contextual (chaining)
          substitutions were not being renamed.</li>

          <li>In the new context chain dlg, simple glyph page had a
          bug which failed to remove the parenthesised unicode
          character after a glyph name (and complained about
          it).</li>

          <li>Change the context chaining dialog. I hope it will be
          easier to use. Unfortunately there are lookups which
          can't be expressed in the new format so retain the old
          format as a fall-back. (Adobe's feature files don't
          support these exceptions either, so I doubt anyone
          actually uses them).</li>

          <li>The lookup panes of font info didn't refresh when
          someone changed the name (Edit metadata) of a lookup or
          subtable.</li>

          <li>It used to be that long menus which didn't fit on the
          screen had up/down arrows at the top and bottom. But for
          very long menus scrolling using this method was slow. So
          this code puts in a scrollbar instead.</li>

          <li>Changed the Size pane of Font Info to use a matrix
          edit for font style names.</li>

          <li>People didn't like the way Glyph Info behaved (They
          wanted the "Done" button to do a "Cancel". So make it
          so.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>21-Feb-2011

        <ul>
          <li>Did a lot of work to improve the accuracy in remove
          overlap. Improved accuracy means that it is less likely
          to do the wrong thing. Problems happen when there are
          points or intersections very close to each other. (So
          quadratic glyphs are more likely to have problems than
          cubics simply because they have more points, on
          average).</li>

          <li>Fix various error messages.</li>

          <li>Remove some obsolete documentation.</li>

          <li>Technical fixes to stroking code.</li>

          <li>Add a miterlimit to stroking code.</li>

          <li>FontForge was using the wrong MIME type for svg
          files. W3C has changed it and it's now "image/svg+xml"
          not "image/svg-xml" or "image/svg".</li>

          <li>Since Inkscape images tend to be at unexpected y
          positions, force the view to rescale/recenter itself if
          the result after a paste/import is outside the current
          window. (Inkscape tends to put things at the top of a
          page, but the origin is at the bottom, and FF looks at
          the origin.</li>

          <li>A line joint of 180 degrees (which shouldn't have
          happened in stroking, but did) caused an infinite
          loop.</li>

          <li>Typo in add extrema code (again).</li>

          <li>Patch from Khaled Hosny: sets correct version of OS/2
          tf table.</li>

          <li>Patch from Khaled Hosny: instead of dumping all
          OtfFeatName's into a single line, dump each on a line of
          its own, this make VCS diffs more readable.</li>

          <li>Commas in the list of bitmap strikes could be
          recognized as a decimal separators when generating fonts
          with bitmap strikes and this caused broken fonts to be
          generated.</li>

          <li>In various places FF was supposed to temporary set
          LC_NUMERIC to `C', but the original locale was actually
          never restored.</li>

          <li>Add a python reverseDirection() method to Layer.</li>

          <li>Make the head_optimized_for_cleartype flag accessible
          via Python interface.</li>

          <li>Patch by Khaled Hosny to allow setting default font
          file base name from python.</li>

          <li>Patch by Khaled Hosny: adds
          &lt;font&gt;.texparameters member to access TeX font
          parameters from Python, readonly for now. The returned
          values can be different from what is present in FF UI due
          to different rounding methods.</li>

          <li>Patch from Khaled Hosny: python's addAnchorPoint()
          function does now check if a similar anchor point exists
          or not, and behaves accordingly.</li>

          <li>When we open an sfd file it can contain flags asking
          us to open charviews for some glyphs. But on the mac, if
          we open more than one charview X11 (usually) crashes. So,
          on the mac, put in a hook that only opens one.</li>

          <li>valgrind found a place where I was looking at freed
          memory.</li>

          <li>In the metrics view list index was not properly
          updated when user was manually selecting an item from the
          word list. So wromg items were selected if (s)he then
          used up/down arrow keys to navigate the list.</li>

          <li>Matthias Kilian spotted a buffer overflow in svg
          processing.</li>

          <li>The fix for LastResort.ttf had an undesired effect:
          each time an sfd file was opened all AltUni entries were
          duplicated.</li>

          <li>Fixed validation crash for references to empty glyphs
          (Fedora bug 536920); patch by Paul Flo Williams</li>

          <li>Patch by Paul Flo Williams to fix a crash when
          resizing toolbox while editing bitmap glyphs.</li>

          <li>Try to get compilation working with multiple versions
          of libpng on the system.</li>

          <li>Khaled Hosny found that deleting the last anchor in a
          glyph causes a crash.</li>

          <li>Khaled Hosny fixed a crash in multiline text editing
          widget.</li>

          <li>Patch by Paul Flo Williams to fix a crash when
          attempting to edit glyphs in Unicode Plane 16.</li>

          <li>Patch by Werner Lemberg to make FF compile with
          Python 2.7.</li>

          <li>Patch by Khaled Hosny to prevent crash when adding
          certain lookup types.</li>

          <li>If one try to compile with -Wall -Wextra, lots of
          warnings show up. The first to fix are nested comments.
          As a result, a value that got, commented out in
          gxdrawtxt.c, probably by accident, is now active.</li>

          <li>Notice from Andrey Panov: FF did not compile with gcc
          4.4.4</li>

          <li>Khaled Hosny made gtk stub compile again.</li>

          <li>Some typos and new comments in autoinstr code.</li>

          <li>Khaled Hosny provided an option in preferences/edit
          to turn off automatic openning of autokern window for any
          new horizontal kerning subtable.</li>

          <li>Patch by Khaled Hosny to fix wrong type conversion
          when assigning GASP values from python script. Spotted by
          Adam Twardoch.</li>

          <li>Make ligature carets accessible from python
          scripts.</li>

          <li>Khaled Hosny noticed that deleting anchors from
          Anchor Info dialog didn't mark glyphs affected as
          changed.</li>

          <li>Patch by Khaled Hosny, who noticed that OpenType
          glyph positioning is applied from left to right even for
          right to left scripts. As he writes:

            <blockquote>
              'This patch fixes the kerning pairs dialog to render
              kerning as close to what OpenType engines does, also
              makes sure FF activates by default and adjusts the
              correct fields. There are other places in the code
              that need to be checked too, but I think the code
              affected by this patch is self contained.'
            </blockquote>
          </li>

          <li>Fixed a crash when FontForge was given NULL glyph
          name in python script.</li>

          <li>Fixed misinterpretation of '+-' in UTF-7 strings read
          from sfd files. Spotted by Paul Flo Williams.</li>

          <li>Fixed misinterpretation of '//' at end of lines read
          from sfd files. Spotted by Paul Flo Williams.</li>

          <li>The statemachine table uses a matrix gadget, but some
          of the code was still expecting a list gadget, causing a
          crash. The patch, by Keith Stribley, also fixes a couple
          of typos and round tripping of the glyphnames</li>

          <li>Patch by Keith Stribley, to fix crashing lookup
          metadata that don't have scripts specified - he points
          that AAT doesn't need them.</li>

          <li>Patch by Keith Stribley, to fix corrupting of single
          substitution lookups used in the state table after
          generating are corrupted.</li>

          <li>Patch by Keith Stribley, to fix export of Mac
          features, though it may not cover every case.</li>

          <li>Patch by Khaled Hosny, to update Unicode support to
          Unicode 6.0.0</li>

          <li>One point in code forgot to check if unicode number
          is in range before testing for alternatives.</li>

          <li>Removed two infinite loops in overlap code. Turned
          out to be a floating point accurracy issue.</li>

          <li>Zoom by mouse scroll scales around mouse pointer
          now.</li>

          <li>Ctrl+A in background layer (in charview window)
          picked up anchor points from foreground layers, too.</li>

          <li>Fontforge forgot to categorize points after importing
          a svg font.</li>

          <li>Patch by Philipp Stephani, to fix wrong
          interpretation of most top accent data for newer versions
          of Cambria Math.</li>

          <li>Patch by Louis Simard: fixes multiple stack based
          buffer overflows in BDF processing routine. Ref:
          https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=659359</li>

          <li>Patch by Barry Schwartz to fix error in handling of
          glyph name ranges in feature files, reported by Matthew
          Skala:</li>

          <li>Fixed crashes on pasting splines into guide layer in
          the glyph view window, reported by Andrey Panov.</li>

          <li>Remove one source of rounding errors in solving
          cubics, clean up function calls to match new calling
          conventions.</li>

          <li>Matthias Kilian notices that previous patch to
          fvimportbdf.c made unterminated strings.</li>

          <li>Khaled Hosny spots a paragraph in the docs that's no
          longer valid.</li>

          <li>Cleanup the fontforge desktop file.</li>

          <li>Freehand tool was very broken.</li>

          <li>When doing remove overlap on quadratic beziers
          (truetype) ff converted them to cubics and then did the
          ro. This introduced slight rounding errors which gave ro
          canniptions. Just as easy to make remove overlap work on
          quadratics too.</li>

          <li>See if we can improve conversion from quadratic
          beziers to cubic. There are rounding errors involved in
          finding the "cubic" control points which mean that the
          cubic term of the spline will be non-zero when it should
          be zero. See if we can find better approximations to the
          control points, and be prepared to force a small third
          order term to 0.</li>

          <li>"Make arc" didn't work as expected for connected
          points (it actually produced a straight line).</li>

          <li>The previous patch for matrixedit was incomplete:
          although the function indicator box was always drawn at
          the visible area of the control, it actually didn't work.
          Moreover, the box was being duplicated multiple times
          during horizontal scrolling. So this is one more attempt
          to make the whole GUI for editing OT glyph classes
          functional again. Note that now the special handling is
          applied only to the last column of a matrix edit control:
          if this column contains text fields with function
          indicators, then those indicators are always drawn at the
          top of the field by a such way that they should always be
          visible.</li>

          <li>Daniel Dumitriu has provided Romanian translations
          for style names.</li>

          <li>Daniel Johnson sent me a print sample of Mayan in the
          K'iche' dialect used in Guatemala from the prolog to the
          Popol Wuj.</li>

          <li>Expand stroke didn't work if the intial spline in a
          contour had a length of 0.</li>

          <li>Khaled points out that if the subtable dlg for a
          single substitution is [Populated] then hovering the
          mouse cursor over an empty cell will cause a crash. (the
          thing that pops up an image of the sustitution failed
          here).</li>

          <li>Legacy scripting did not support importing pdf
          files.</li>

          <li>There used to be two preference item controling
          autohinting. That does not seem a good idea, so coelesce
          them into one preference item.</li>

          <li>_strtod could munch the stack if given a long string.
          This caused crashes, etc.</li>

          <li>Fixed a number of problems with the mm dlg:

            <ol>
              <li>of the design vector were bigger than 60
              characters then ff would crash (happened if there
              were more than 2 axes)</li>

              <li>default values for the Slant access were
              backwards</li>

              <li>Convert-Design-Vector functions were wrong for 3
              &amp; 4 axis designs.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>The freehand dlg did not retain the previous shape of
          a polygonal nib. It always used the default shape each
          time it was invoked.</li>

          <li>More problems with zero length splines in expand
          stroke. Biggest problem was that the routine which was
          suppposed to remove them didn't (at least in some
          cases).</li>

          <li>Add a link to the panose docs from the panose pane of
          fontinfo.</li>

          <li>Add strings and support for other latin panose
          families.</li>

          <li>Patch by Werner Lemberg to improve rasterization
          accuracy in TTF debugger.</li>

          <li>Trying to create a new kerning subtable from font
          info would often crash.</li>

          <li>Brian Zick wanted a preference item so that if one
          end of a spline were moved and the other were not then
          the control points would be interpolated (rather than
          being moved by the same amount as the adjacent end
          point).

            <p>Note that this will have problems if the moving end
            point ever ends up on the same horizontal/vertical line
            as the stationary end point. Then the control point may
            vanish and never reappear.</p>
          </li>

          <li>Add a bit more info to the version string (whether
          compiled for doubles, etc.)</li>

          <li>When modifying OT classes by inserting glyphs from a
          fontview-based window, the add_char_to_name_list
          preference item was not respected.</li>

          <li>FF used to allow modifying the width (and vwidth) of
          a bitmap glyph only in bitmap-only fonts. This seems to
          make no sense for TTF, where widths of rasterized glyphs
          can be set independently for each PPEM.</li>

          <li>Use FT_LOAD_TARGET_MONO instead of FT_LOAD_MONOCHROME
          for spline rasterization with freetype. This guarantees
          more accurate rendering of hinted fonts in monochrome
          mode.</li>

          <li>If a font contains several sets of kerning classes
          (e. g. for different scripts), and a particular glyph is
          present in more than one set, then attempting to find a
          matching kerning value between this glyph and a
          subsequent glyph might result in selecting the
          combination with the {Everything Else} class from the
          first set being processed, even if there are better
          matches in other sets.

            <p>Also FF would still complain that the "{Everythin
            Else}" string in the kern class dialog represents a
            missing glyph.</p>
          </li>

          <li>Two small corrections for metrics view:

            <ol>
              <li>Since the {Everything Else} class is now
              recognized by FF as a valid glyph class, it was
              possible to occasionally modify a kerning value
              involving this class in the metrics view. So when
              asking user if he is going to modify a class-based
              kerning value or create a new kerning pair, inform
              him if one of the glyphs from this pair has been
              actually matched by the {Everything Else} class.</li>

              <li>Make it possible to easily deselect all glyphs in
              the metrics view by pressing [Escape].</li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>Pasting bitmaps from fontview didn't work.</li>

          <li>Allow a user to enter values for the PS private
          dictionary in his/her own locale but convert them to the
          "C"==PostScript locale when storing them. That is a
          French user could enter [3,5 20] for BlueValues, but it
          needs to be converted to [3.5 20] when put in the sfd
          file (or PS font file).</li>

          <li>Change the Histogram dialog to use boxes (cosmetic
          change, shouldn't matter to English speakers, dlg won't
          have fields overrunning other fields in French).</li>

          <li>Redo the "PS Private" pane of the Font Info dialog so
          that it uses a matrix edit rather than the old clumsy
          list with editing area kludge.</li>

          <li>Patch by Khaled Hosny to fix crash when importing svg
          with linked image.</li>

          <li>The scripting function "FontsInFile" did not support
          pdf files, and always returned an empty array when asking
          if they contained fonts.</li>

          <li>Scripting didn't let anyone pick a subfont within a
          pdf file. (did not support: filename(fontname) notation
          for pdf).</li>

          <li>Update cidmap to CNS-1.6.</li>

          <li>My cidmap files have always been a one to one mapping
          of cid to unicode. But that's not what Adobe does. Many
          cids get mapped to several code points each. So I've
          revamped the format to support this. The new map files
          need the new code (obviously) so don't download one
          without the other.</li>

          <li>An earlier patch added support for horizontal
          scrolling (shift trackwheel) in the outline glyph window.
          This builds on that and supports it in (I hope) all
          windows. Also adds support for apple's wheel which can do
          both horizontal and vertical motion.</li>

          <li>When ff calculated the size of a kerning subtable it
          was off by two bytes per glyph in the coverage table.
          This meant that it would sometimes make a table that was
          slightly too big to be supported and not realize it. I've
          fixed the bug, and put in checks so that if there's yet
          another problem like this, at list it will be reported to
          the user.</li>

          <li>It is now possible to differentiate stems by width
          (rather than by direction) in the "Change glyph" dialog.
          This approach produces better results for glyphs like "N"
          or "g", and thus seems more logical even for the Latin
          script, where vertical stems are normally "thick" and
          horizontal ones are "thin".

            <p>This patch also affects some gdraw internals, since
            the new layout of the "Change glyph" dialog makes it
            necessary to dynamically switch the captions of some
            labels, and the text strings should fit to the space
            initially reserved for those labels. So it is now
            possible to assign a list of strings to a label, just
            like if it was a list button.</p>
          </li>

          <li>Fix some issues with hv points.</li>

          <li>Do some internal cleanup.</li>

          <li>User doesn't like that ff does a "fit to window" ever
          time the user resizes the window. So... let's try not
          doing that.</li>

          <li>Someone complained that when the fontview was
          maximized it would make itself one cell smaller than it
          should have. Well that's screen size and window manager
          dependant. It did allow 10 pixels of horizontal border
          (not knowing what the WM would give it). That's probably
          too much. And even if a tiny bit of the window is off the
          screen, it probably doesn't matter much.</li>

          <li>When ff was started with a .ufo fontdirectory on the
          command line, it would fail to open it (and produce a
          garbage error message). I suspect the underlying problem
          would cause other problems too, but haven't found any
          yet.</li>

          <li>Barry points out that FF incorrectly loaded an
          opentype font with an empty bluevalues array (FF showed
          it as not having a bluevalues array at all, the two are
          different). (pfb files with empty arrays worked as
          expected).</li>

          <li>Correct two "bugs" in UFO output. I believe that I
          was following the spec in both cases, but since the
          reference implimentation does not follow the spec I shall
          do what it does instead.

            <ol>
              <li>The spec gives a complex algorithm for converting
              a glyph name to a filename. The proper behavior
              appears to be "add an underscore immediately after
              every capital letter" and leave it at that.</li>

              <li>The spec says for OS2 fsType we should output bit
              numbers. It doesn't mean the numbers of the bits
              (0..15) but rather the values (0..1).</li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>Retain the UFO ascender and descender fields.</li>

          <li>Werner found a place where apple kerning output
          didn't work if glyphs which weren't being output had
          kerning pairs associated with them.</li>

          <li>Richard Gitschlag and Khaled complain that the Glyph
          Info dlg says "Done" rather than "Cancel".

            <p>There is a reason for this. The button does not do a
            cancel. It only cancels changes to the current glyph,
            but the dlg can be applied to several glyphs one after
            another, and any changes made to previous glyphs are
            committed when the user changes glyphs. So the "Done"
            button only cancels the current glyph.</p>

            <p>However, I can change it so that it says "Cancel"
            until the user changes glyphs. And in most cases the
            user is only interested in one glyph so this will solve
            most of the problem...</p>
          </li>

          <li>Richard Gitshlag suggests that the buttons in the
          "non-integral coordinates" question of validation are
          confusing and suggests they be relabeled.</li>

          <li>More fixes needed where *printf expects a double and
          gets a long double if --enabel-longdouble.</li>

          <li>According to the spec there are two different types
          of GPOS 'size' feature. One specifies a design size and
          nothing else, the other specifies a design size, a design
          range a style name and a magic number used to associate
          all fonts in the same family with the same weight and
          style but with different design sizes.

            <p>Fontforge was not very good about warning the user
            when s/he created something which had some but not all
            of these attributes. (ie. a design range but no style
            name). So add some error messages to the fontinfo dlg
            which makes these checks.</p>

            <p>FF would also not read in a 'size' feature unless it
            were in one of these formats. So if the user created a
            'size' feature with a design size, and a design range
            but no style name, then FF would not complain, would
            happily output it, but would not read it back in again.
            So be a little more lenient in what we read in.</p>
          </li>

          <li>Sort human-readable stylistic set names (first by
          feature tag, then by language) both in the FontInfo
          dialog and in SFD output.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>13-Feb-2011

        <ul>
          <li>Switched from cvs to git.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>29-Apr-2010

        <ul>
          <li>A new algorithm for stroking splines. Allows the user
          to specify arbitrary convex polygons as pens as well as
          more traditional circles (ellipses) and slanted
          rectangles (calligraphic pens). (It should also produce
          better results and each resultant contour will have no
          self-intersections)

            <p>Extended the python interface so you can specify a
            polygon pen.</p>
          </li>

          <li>Add support for the <a href=
          "http://people.mozilla.com/~jkew/woff/woff-2009-09-16.html">
          Web Open Font Format</a> (woff) which is basically just
          an sfnt with its tables compressed and some extra
          metadata. New pane in Font Info dlg, and python support
          for that info.</li>

          <li>Redo Auto Kerning. Add support for automagically
          generating kerning classes and auto kerning those
          classes. Rework most of the kerning related dialogs.
          Provide python interfaces to all this.</li>

          <li>Compile with libpng1.4.</li>

          <li>Add two python methods:

            <ul>
              <li>contour.similar</li>

              <li>layer.similar</li>
            </ul>

            <p>which allow you to compare two contours (or layers)
            and specify an error bound on how far they may
            diverge.</p>
          </li>

          <li>Khaled would like access to the math constant table
          from python. Add a set of fields<br />
          font.math.&lt;math-constant-name&gt; to the font, and a
          set of fields to the glyph for math kerning, variants and
          composition.</li>

          <li>If the method of approximating a cubic spline by
          subdivision fails, then relax the precision requirements
          for a match, and try again.</li>

          <li>Add support for the "style" attribute from svg
          1.2.</li>

          <li>python glyph.ImportOutlines would crash if it were
          not given a flags argument.</li>

          <li>Barry reports that the metrics view crashes for him
          because things in the pairwise kerning subtable pulldown
          list are sometimes garbage. Mmm. This can happen if the
          user has a metrics view open and then uses font info to
          delete a kerning subtable (or lookup). (And presses [OK]
          in fontinfo).</li>

          <li>Suppress warnings about 'showpage' operator when
          importing PS files.</li>

          <li>I have been trying for years to figure out how to
          apply least-squares to this problem. I kept having 4
          equations and 2 unknowns. An over specified system with
          no solutions. I realized last night that I was looking at
          the problem wrong (of course). Instead of seperating it
          into x and y components and minimizing errors in each, I
          should have been minimizing the sum of the x and y
          errors. Simple. Worked first try. Makes stroking about
          10-15 times faster.</li>

          <li>When doing square pens or polygons then long bendy
          splines will be broken up roughly every 90 degrees (every
          time we switch verteces, actually). That turns out to be
          a good thing (makes it easier to approximate the curve).
          It doesn't happen automagically for circle pens, so add a
          little bit of code that detects 90 degree slope
          transitions and inserts a point there. Results are more
          accurate now.</li>

          <li>The various dialogs involving the fontview did not
          resize properly when the user changed the display
          size.</li>

          <li>FF failed to put a trailing NUL on some strings for
          glyph classes resulting in strange displays (and
          complaints from pango about bad utf8 strings).</li>

          <li>Patch by François Charette to allow UTF8 to be
          spelled as "utf8" in locales.</li>

          <li>Some users don't like having the character
          representation of a glyph name showing up in lists of
          glyph names, so add a preference item: Prefs-&gt;Font
          Info-&gt;AddCharToNameList to let them turn that
          off.</li>

          <li>If you have freetype rasterizing in the metrics view,
          and if you are working on a cubic layer, nd if you are
          editing a glyph in a char view and looking at it in the
          metrics view, and if you make a change to the glyph --
          then Undo doesn't do what you expect. Instead the glyph
          gets autohinted (by default) before a font is generated
          for freetype, and a hint undo gets added to the undo
          list. Undo undoes the hint change (which the user
          probably isn't aware of) and leaves his/her changes
          untouched.</li>

          <li>Andrew Robbins points out that when generating an svg
          font the unicode-range attribute should look like
          U+0020-0E4A rather than U+0020-U+0E4A (no second
          U+).</li>

          <li>d binderman points out a missing closedir.<br />
          Also d binderman points out that I was missing an fclose
          in archive processing.</li>

          <li>FontForge failed to handle archives with double
          extensions (like ".tar.bz2").</li>

          <li>Typo in code for parsing extenders in tfm file.</li>

          <li>The python operators which tested if two contours
          were equivalent would crash when called.</li>

          <li>Add a "dup()" member to Points, Layers and Contours
          to produce a deep copy of the object.</li>

          <li>The default __iter__ for a selection type (in python)
          didn't work. It was supposed to return all the selected
          encoding slots (that is, numbers) instead it returned the
          empty set (when I tested it, actually it's return would
          be random depending on an uninitialized variable).</li>

          <li>Some seemingly valid bdf fonts were rejected. Thanks
          to Andrey V. Panov for providing a sample.</li>

          <li>Patch from Alan Coopersmith to fix "showttf -verbose
          filename" behavior.</li>

          <li>Khaled Hosny spots duplicate "Descent" fields written
          to sfd files.</li>

          <li>When generating a cursive attachment anchor lookup
          fontforge did two passes through the glyph list. The
          first did everything needed. And the second thought it
          was handling marks (rather than cursives) and produced
          garbage.</li>

          <li>The clockwise check sometimes gave up when it should
          not have.</li>

          <li>When generating a feature file for a mark to mark
          lookup fontforge could generate gibberish.</li>

          <li>Three bugs in reading feature files:

            <ol>
              <li>FF dereference garbage (and probably, but not
              necessarily) crash when parsing a glyph class with no
              glyphs in it inside an anchor specification.</li>

              <li>When freeing data describing a list of anchors FF
              would crash if one of the anchors were defined to be
              NULL</li>

              <li>A multiple substitution entry with just a single
              element in it looks exactly like a single
              substitution. FF would complain about multiple
              substitution lookups containing both single and
              multiple entries.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>Hot keys for the grid fit Bigger/Smaller pointsize
          menu commands got lost when I merged in the mingw
          changes. (Not saying the fault lies with the mingw
          people, that's just when they vanished. I might have
          removed them myself).</li>

          <li>The bluezones weren't marked in the charview when
          hinting display was turned off. Patch by Michal
          Nowakowski.</li>

          <li>Merge fonts doesn't merge bitmap strikes if one font
          has a different number of strikes than the other. Patch
          by Won-Kyu Park.</li>

          <li>Jeff Harmon reports that ff writes "Postscript" into
          PFM files rather than "PostScript" and that this matters.
          Change all instances of "Postscript" to
          "PostScript".</li>

          <li>FF crashes if asked to produce a small-caps variant
          of a lower case letter for which there is no
          corresponding upper case. Patch from Rogerio Brito via
          debian.</li>

          <li>Some time ago MS put in a patch to their OS so that
          they would refuse to load a font with a name table
          &gt;5K. They have now decided that was an error
          http://support.microsoft.com/kb/978909/ And have removed
          the limitation.

            <p>So remove the warning ff used to generate about name
            tables bigger than 5K.</p>
          </li>

          <li>Complain when the user attempts to put a unicode
          copyright symbol into the copyright string of a
          PostScript font.</li>

          <li>The Hint-&gt;Edit cvt dlg would crash if you resized
          the dlg window.</li>

          <li>Couple of patches from Louis Simard:

            <ol>
              <li>in the kern class dlg, if classes were very long
              then could segfault when displaying popup messages
              listing both first and second class members.</li>

              <li>Would complain that the special case string
              "{Everything Else}" was a missing glyph.</li>

              <li>Would crash when switching from a newly-created
              First class entry directly to the &lt;FNew&gt; entry
              at the bottom of the Second class column.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>MatrixEdits with up/down buttons never enabled the
          down button.</li>

          <li>FF could display multiline utf8 textfield strings
          incorrectly.</li>

          <li>Updated Vietnamese translation from Clytie. He also
          fixes various typos on my part.</li>

          <li>Added a new python function to the module:
          fontforge.unitShape(n) which returns a contour containing
          a regular n-gon.</li>

          <li>Grab many patches from the mingw build. I did not
          grab the winmmap files because I'm not sure what the
          license is for that.</li>

          <li>Patch by Michal to remove some hard coded colors in
          the ff ui (mostly yellow for selections and black for
          text).</li>

          <li>If FF had to split a GPOS pairwise kerning subtable
          into several bits (because it was bigger than 65535) then
          ff would go into an infinite loop -- at least
          sometimes.</li>

          <li>Fix another place where I was using strcpy against
          the spec.</li>

          <li>When doing a Rename to Namelist operation prior to
          generating a font, FF neglected to clear the glyph-name
          hash table. This meant that any glyph lookups by name on
          renamed glyphs would fail. Meaning we would inexplicably
          lose substitutions.</li>

          <li>On 64 bit machines, in a contextual chaining display,
          nested lookups were not shown by name.</li>

          <li>When FF lists glyph names, it appends the unicode
          character of the glyph after the name. It probably should
          not do that if the glyph name maps to the private use
          area -- if the display font has a glyph there, it
          probably won't match the one in the designed font and
          will just add confusion.</li>

          <li>In a list of a simple substitution subtable the arrow
          between glyphs was pointing the wrong way so it looked as
          if the replacement glyph became the source glyph.</li>

          <li>At Kevin Fenzi's request warn about use of seac
          instructions in type2 charstrings. Similarly warn about
          other type1 but not type2 operators (we warned about
          some. I think I'm now warning about all).</li>

          <li>New copyright notices for 2010.</li>

          <li>Unicode 5.2</li>

          <li>FontForge had no error checking for bad GIDs in the
          JSTF table.</li>

          <li>A bad 'kern' table could send fontforge into an
          infinite loop.</li>

          <li>Patch from Stephen Hartke, contour slicing still not
          working properly.</li>

          <li>More patches from Barry to make ff work with Python
          3</li>

          <li>Annie Olsen of SIL says that the big tick marks in
          the rulers in the glyph window aren't obvious enough. So
          make them longer and of a different color.</li>

          <li>Patch by Tilman Blumenbach. Legacy scripting GetPrefs
          crashed when asked about "AutotraceArgs".</li>

          <li>Patch by Khaled to add an optional flags argument to
          the python glyph.importOutlines()</li>

          <li>Patch from Alexey Kryukov to make legacy scripting
          commands GetAnchorPoints and AddAnchorPoint to be
          consistant.</li>

          <li>Patch by Martin Hosken to fix some problems with UFO
          metrics output.</li>

          <li>Patch by Michal Nowakowski to fix an autohinting
          problem with hint masks.</li>

          <li>FF used to map the characters U+1D400-U+1D7FF to
          equivalent ascii (in the appropriate font). Khaled says
          that Pango can do that for us.</li>

          <li>Patch by Khaled to add some missing feature
          tags.</li>

          <li>Allow the user to provide a python routine which will
          calculate the optical spacing between two glyphs. Used to
          override fontforge's default routine when calculating
          autokern, autowidth and left and right optical
          bounds.<br />
          fontforge.registerGlyphSeparationHook</li>

          <li>I recently broke loading sfd files which contain
          multiple kerning subtables.</li>

          <li>Rework the other dialogs which use glyph classes (or
          sets) so that they now use matrix edits (which I hope
          make more sense) and have better glyph entry, in line
          with the kerning dlg.</li>

          <li>The Goto Char dlg now has an option (when executed in
          the fontview) to merge the new glyph into the selection
          (before it simply set the selection to the new
          glyph).</li>

          <li>Panov complains that the afii* names (and uni* or u*)
          don't mean much. So when we have a glyph name (or a list
          of glyph names) append the unicode character itself to
          the name inside parens. I don't do this everywhere yet,
          but moving in that direction. (don't do this for glyph
          names where it is obvious (like "A"), nor for names that
          might cause parsing confusion (like close paren itself or
          space)).</li>

          <li>Add an autokern command to python.</li>

          <li>Use autokerning idea to find (default) optical bounds
          when filling up 'lfbd' and 'rtbd'</li>

          <li>Someone pointed out that Clockwise and
          CounterClockwise should only be disabled if the selected
          contours self-intersect, while correct direction should
          be disabled if there are any intersections.</li>

          <li>PDF has changed since I last downloaded the spec, and
          Barry wanted support for Cross-reference streams (which
          required also supporting object streams).</li>

          <li>Apple keeps changing the environment. In 10.2 the
          Option key would produce the keyboard state mask of
          0x2000. In 10.4 it produced 0x0008. In 10.6 it again
          produces 0x2000. Constant change makes it difficult to
          create a program which will work on all versions of the
          OS.</li>

          <li>Patch by Alexey K so that ff will look for (and
          parse) unicode cmaps when loading fonts from pdf files.
          Loaded fonts will then have an encoding rather than just
          being a list of glyphs.</li>

          <li>Memory bug when generating ttc files with a 'post'
          table.</li>

          <li>Barry points out that some fields in OS/2 were set
          incorrectly if the font were a cff.</li>

          <li>in winfonts.c under 64 bit mode, the
          sizeof(FARPROC16) is 8 rather than 4 and this screws up
          the font dump. We'd already fixed it for FARPROC, but
          FARPROC16 escaped. Thanks to Alexey.</li>

          <li>Was writing random memory locations on 64 bit
          machines when generating ttc files (possibly on 32
          machines too, but no crashes involved and valgrind didn't
          find anything).</li>

          <li>Several fixes to the resource editor.</li>

          <li>Alexey suggests that Control + Mouse wheel should
          Zoom the metrics window just as it does the glyph
          view.</li>

          <li>Fix a couple of problems with the Set Point Size dlg
          of the metrics view.</li>

          <li>Blending a new Apple MM instance left us in a font
          with no encoding.</li>

          <li>The pulldown list in the apple version of the MM dlg
          did not get set to the correct default value.</li>

          <li>Attempt to free something that should not have been
          freed in MM dlg.</li>

          <li>Loading LastResort.ttf was extremely slow because
          some glyphs had hundreds of thousands of altunis and
          whenever we added a new one we went all through that list
          to check for duplicates. When parsing a standard encoding
          there won't be any duplicates.</li>

          <li>More problems reading apple tables from ttc files.
          Some crashes, etc.</li>

          <li>Barry wants to have review hints regenerate
          substitution points and hint masks.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>11-Sept-2009

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge will now generate ttc files. It has two
          options:

            <ul>
              <li>share a common glyf table (not always
              possible)</li>

              <li>Use CFF output.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>There is also a python command
            font.generateTtc()</p>
          </li>

          <li>Barry points out that some fields in OS/2 were set

          <li>Clean up some minor issues which show up on Mac
          10.6</li>

          <li>Patch by Alexey to add a NameFromUnicode function to
          both native and python scripting.</li>

          <li>Drag &amp; dropping a glyph into the metrics view
          didn't mark the end of string properly so cruft left over
          could be displayed.</li>

          <li>In CharView Element-&gt;Join and Element-&gt;Correct
          Direction were turned off when they should not have
          been.</li>

          <li>Patch by Khaled to add some feature names to my list
          and extend the lookup type to which others apply.</li>

          <li>new python fields:

            <ul>
              <li>glyph.topaccent</li>

              <li>glyph.italicCorrection</li>

              <li>glyph.isExtendedShape</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Khaled provides a patch. 'Top Accent Pos' value in
          Glyph Info -&gt; TeX &amp; Math was not being retained
          when user pressed OK.</li>

          <li>Alexey points out that wordlists in the metrics view
          really assumed ASCII letters and didn't handle utf8
          well.</li>

          <li>Patch by Michal to render more strings
          translateable.</li>

          <li>See if I can speed up execution of "&lt;glyphname&gt;
          in &lt;font&gt;"</li>

          <li>Patch by Alexey K to add two preference items which
          control features of the autohintor/instructor.</li>

          <li>Dave Crossland tells me that some security patch to
          windows considers fonts with a 'name' table bigger than
          5K to be insecure (Don't ask me why they think this) and
          windows will refuse to load any such fonts. This means
          Windows won't load any font with the Open Font License in
          the 'name' table. This patch adds three checks:

            <ol>
              <li>When generating a font it will let the user know
              if the name table is too big.</li>

              <li>When loading a font in validation mode it will
              warn if the name table is too big.</li>

              <li>Font Info will make a rough approximation to the
              size of the name table (an approximation which will
              always be too small) and warn if this approximation
              is bigger than 5K</li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>When opening a ttf file the guideline psuedo-layer
          was cubic not quadratic.</li>

          <li>Patch by Michal:

            <ul>
              <li>Duplicate "Raster Dark Color" in xresources
              editor.<br />
              "Delta Grid Color" was really meant the second
              time</li>

              <li>Duplicate charview-&gt;point-&gt;tools-&gt;rotate
              menu item.</li>

              <li>In charview palettes, it was impossible to unset
              "don't stroke" in freehand</li>

              <li>Charview-&gt;hinting-&gt;autohint and
              Charview-&gt;hinting-&gt;autoinstr were not<br />
              disabled if guide were the active layer. This
              resulted in segfaults</li>

              <li>In GlyphInfo-&gt;Unicode, "variant selector"
              matrix had headers untranslated.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Autoinstructor: added aspect-ratio correction for new
          diagonal code.</li>

          <li>Autoinstructor: pushes EF2Dot14 values in a more
          compact manner.</li>

          <li>In the metricsview Cut/Copy/Paste/Undo/Redo menu
          commands all apply to the textfields as well as the
          glyphs. So don't disable them. It used not to matter
          because disabling didn't affect the shortcuts, but it
          does now.</li>

          <li><code>File-&gt;X Resource
          Editor...-&gt;FontView-&gt;Font Size</code> was supposed
          to allow the user to set the size of the glyph labels in
          the fontview. It didn't. Fixed.</li>

          <li>Add a new problem (Find Problems) and a new
          validation state indicative of whether a glyph (or hint
          mask) has overlapping hints.</li>

          <li>Patch by Alexandre Prokoudine to make an error
          message translatable.</li>

          <li>Patch by Stephen Hartke to make contour splicing (in
          fontforge's python module) work the way splicing normally
          does in python.</li>

          <li>Back in the dark ages adobe provide a set of
          encodings for the PUA. For instance A.small was encoded
          into PUA. Nowadays it is thought better to leave A.small
          unencoded. But if a modern font contained an A.small
          glyph FontForge would think it should be encoded into the
          PUA. So I added a preference item to turn off adobe's
          obsolete names.

            <p>Sadly the preference item wasn't very smart and
            turned off names like uE001 as well. Fix that.</p>
          </li>

          <li>Autoinstructor: made much faster by caching
          SplinePointListIsClockwise() results.</li>

          <li>Problem when converting an OpenType contextual
          subtable to an Apple state machine.</li>

          <li>If an old-style kerning table kerns glyphs which are
          outside unicode BMP then windows has problems. Someone
          provide a patch to check for this. Sadly the patch had a
          bug which could cause crashes.</li>

          <li>Autoinstructor: patch from Alexey to fix artifacts
          caused by diagonal hints at small and medium PPEMs. Code
          now sets projection vector from the stack, because that's
          more accurate than using dual projection vector, so some
          font validators may give warnings due to
          aspect-ratio-dependent nature of SPVFS.</li>

          <li>Autoinstructor: Alexey pointed out that inaccurate
          strong points interpolation caused assymetry of implied
          perpendicular extremas.</li>

          <li>I was intended to translate espace_espace_i to
          space_space_i and espace.small to space.small but that
          didn't work.</li>

          <li>When renaming a font to a new namelist I only renamed
          glyphs, but not the places where glyph names ocurred in
          lookups or math variants.</li>

          <li>I used to have a separate set of default Generate
          [Option] flags for ttf and otf. There's no real need for
          that, and it's probably a bit confusing, and it makes
          life hard with ttc files.</li>

          <li>Typo in code for converting an OpenType contextual
          sub to an apple state machine.</li>

          <li>Hunh. If we configured with gb12345 then that
          encoding appeared twice in the encoding list and the
          first occurance was broken. Remove the broken
          occurance.</li>

          <li>Barry complains that when a feature file creates
          glyphs which aren't in the encoding then those glyphs
          aren't visible (until you reencode, of course). This
          causes confusion. I think the solution is simply to
          encode the new glyphs.</li>

          <li>Patch by Michal. Some of the strings for the new
          delta suggestor were not marked for translation (also
          resizing the window didn't reset the scrollbar
          properly).</li>

          <li>Add a new python method glyph.preserveLayerAsUndo()
          to add an undo to the undo list which will restore the
          layer to its current state.</li>

          <li>embedded bitmaps in CID keyed fonts didn't work.</li>

          <li>Interpolate fonts would screw up internals if the
          first font had a layer count which wasn't 2. This would
          almost certainly cause a crash later.</li>

          <li>Hunh. Python creates an iterator for my cvt type
          which doesn't work. So create a real one.</li>

          <li>Barry wanted a selection field in python
          glyph.anchorPoints so create a new routine
          glyph.anchorPointsWithSel()</li>

          <li>Patch from Peter, python cvt[i] returned an unsigned
          value.</li>

          <li>Python cvt.find function crashed if there were no cvt
          table.</li>

          <li>Werner suggests that .02 is a better default value
          for delta checking than .01.</li>

          <li>When generating a type3 font from a script, ff would
          convert to type0 if it had a two byte encoding.</li>

          <li>Werner keeps asking for a clearer header in the GASP
          part of fontinfo.</li>

          <li>When generating a temporary font for rasterization
          purposes, don't output GPOS GSUB, or any AAT tables.</li>

          <li>Patch by Herbert Duerr. With traditional 'kern'
          tables, windows has problems with kerning glyphs which do
          not have BMP encodings. So produce a warning in this
          case.</li>

          <li>SVG kerning produced garbage. Two typos. Patch by
          Simo Kinnunen.</li>

          <li>Bug in feature file (and hence UFO) output. When
          outputing a contextual class-based lookup ff would crash
          if class 0 was unused.</li>

          <li>Werner requests a command to check when a spline gets
          very close to the center of a pixel as this might be a
          candidate for a delta instruction. That is: Grid fit many
          glyphs at many pixel sizes and see which splines come
          close to which pixel centers. This is a functional but
          ugly implementation.</li>

          <li>Add mnemonics for the first 10 layers (Guide is _0,
          Back _1, Fore _2, &lt;user layer 1&gt; _3, ...). Guide,
          Back and Fore already had mnemonics... Now they have
          two.</li>

          <li>You can rebind the charview menus separately from the
          others.

            <p>If you have an entry like:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <pre>
  msgid "CV*Open|Ctl+O"
  msgstr "Super+O"
</pre>
            </blockquote>

            <p>then that will rebind Open in the charview and
            nowhere else.</p>

            <p>Note that the string "CV*Open|Ctl+O" will not appear
            in the pot file, you must add it manually if you want
            to do this (that's because I don't want people to do
            this).</p>

            <p>If you have a rebinding for</p>

            <blockquote>
              <pre>
  msgid "Open|Ctl+O"
</pre>
            </blockquote>

            <p>and no entry for "CV*Open|Ctl+O" (ie. the common
            case) then all menus (including the charview) will
            follow the standard rebinding.</p>
          </li>

          <li>When listing all languages used in a script, ff would
          only look at gpos.</li>

          <li>When creating an ellipse or rectangle, ff would round
          the points to be integers -- but it would not refigure
          the splines after doing that (so the spline polynomials
          do not actually reach their endpoints causing peculiar
          errors).</li>

          <li>When reading a featurefile from a ufo there is no
          associated fv yet, but there is an associated map. Use
          the map instead of fv-&gt;map when checking
          encodings.</li>

          <li>FF was not translating the spiro point menu in
          charview.</li>

          <li>Add a mechanism so user can specify a modifier mask
          to be applied to characters for navigation. Used to be
          that user typed "a" and the glyph for "a" was selected in
          the fontview (or the charview shifted to show "a"). No
          modifier was used. Now I've added "NavigationMask|None"
          to the pot file for hotkeys. If left as "None" then there
          will continue to be no modifier. If changed to something
          like "Super" then the super key must be used.</li>

          <li>Set Width (Set Right Bearing, etc.) from the fontview
          would change the width of a glyph even if it were
          composite with a "use my metrics" reference.</li>

          <li>If cairo was turned off, and a glyph had background
          images, then deleting those images (Cut or Clear) in the
          charview did not update the display. (That's a
          simplification, but is what it looked like).</li>

          <li>In python font.save(), if the script does not specify
          a filename, and the font isn't associated with an sfd
          file, then generate the same name as used in SaveAs by
          default.</li>

          <li>FF can save spiro info into an sfnt. Unfortunately FF
          didn't read it back in properly.</li>

          <li>Autoinstructor: patch from Alexey to fix a bug
          reported by Andrey V. Panov: - sometives the last
          vertical stem protruded beyond the advance width.</li>

          <li>Various patches from Michal. Array bounds out of
          bound kind of thing.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>22-June-2009

        <ul>
          <li>Apple seems to have broken the X11 clipboard around
          10.5.7. Or so other people tell me. I can't reproduce the
          issue on my 10.5.7 system.

            <p>I hope I have worked around this by adding a
            preference item<br />
            &nbsp;
            &nbsp;File-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Generic-&gt;ExportClipboard<br />

            Turn this <strong>Off</strong> if the clipboard doesn't
            seem to work.</p>

            <p>Peter Baker says that a solution is to go into X11
            Preferences, click on the "Input" tab, and uncheck
            "Enable key equivalents under X11".</p>

            <p>Possibly downloading a new set of developer tools
            will fix it:</p>
            <pre>
  http://developer.apple.com/Tools/
    (then log in, (or become a member &amp; log in, it's free))
  Click on Downloads
  In the "Downloads" side bar, click on "Developer Tools"
  Download and Install 3.1.3
</pre>
          </li>

          <li>Add support for friendly names attached to style set
          features (New in OTF 1.6).</li>

          <li>Add support for Mark Sets (New in OTF 1.6)</li>

          <li>Serhij Dubyk has provided a Ukrainian UI.</li>

          <li>Alexandre Prokoudine has updated the Russian UI.</li>

          <li>Updated Polish translation from Michal</li>

          <li>Various patches from Michal fixing some out of bound
          array references.</li>

          <li>Added a cvt.find method to the python cvt object
          which returns the index in the cvt table of a given value
          (or -1 if not found).</li>

          <li>Two issues:

            <ul>
              <li>Apple has changed the name of the preference file
              for X11. Annoying. Pointless.</li>

              <li>Apple (or xorg) has changed the default setting
              of DISPLAY.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Together these meant that ff did not use appropriate
            command keys in the menus.<br />
            I wish Apple wouldn't do pointless changes.</p>
          </li>

          <li>When faced with non-integral coordinates ff would
          sometimes introduce rounding errors so the start and end
          of a contour were slightly different in type1 output. I
          think this is now fixed...</li>

          <li>Fix some problems with the non-linear transform
          dlg.</li>

          <li>Add a nltransform method (non-linear transform) to
          python font, glyph and layer.</li>

          <li>python simplify could crash.</li>

          <li>Patch by Michal to fix problem when compiled with
          long doubles.</li>

          <li>If used twice, tilepath would screw up memory.</li>

          <li>Someone wants a Reverse contour direction command (in
          addition to correct contour direction).</li>

          <li>The code used to check bounding boxes in otf fonts
          had a bug which caused it to report a minimum value of 0
          when the min value was positive. This meant we got
          erroneous reports of points outside the font's bounding
          box in fontlint.</li>

          <li>The code used to check spline intersections had a
          typo which occasionally caused erroneous intersections to
          be reported.</li>

          <li>fontlint said bad 'glyf' table when it meant bad
          glyph data in CFF table.</li>

          <li>If a font had multiple glyphs in the ff clipboard,
          and we sent that clipboard through X11 (rather than just
          using the internal clip) then only one glyph would come
          out on the other side. Provide a mechanism for specifying
          multiple glyphs in the X clipboard too.</li>

          <li>Refined fix to 'kern pair loss' problem, reported by
          Louis Simard. There probably was also a similar 'ligature
          loss' problem.</li>

          <li>Fixed buffer overrun when filling GASP with default
          values.</li>

          <li>Enlarging Metrics window made the feature pane and
          kerning values grid illegible.</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug reported by Louis Simard:<br />
          'Build composite glyph' was enabled in wrong situations
          and crashed.</li>

          <li>when saving an sfd after adding a new "kerning by
          classes" subtable and cancelling its edit dialog.</li>

          <li>FF crashes just after closing an open spiro contour
          (by dragging its first point over the last one, and then
          a bit further).</li>

          <li>When reading strings from the name table, certain
          platform/specific settings would cause ff to:

            <ol>
              <li>read the wrong string</li>

              <li>screw up memory.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>Consolidate various mechanisms for finding the
          xHeight/capHeight of a font. Look for flat lines at the
          top of appropriate glyphs and then snap to the closest
          bluevalue. If no flat lines, then try curves.</li>

          <li>Output Cap/X Height into UFO.</li>

          <li>Add new python commands

            <ul>
              <li>font.capHeight</li>

              <li>font.xHeight</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Was outputting dates within &lt;date&gt; but should
          be in &lt;string&gt; when generating UFO files.</li>

          <li>A font with erroneous GSUB tables (referring to
          non-existant glyphs) and an incomplete set of glyphs
          (caused by having bitmaps for glyphs without outlines)
          caused ff to crash.</li>

          <li>In svg paths, if you omit a command after a 'moveto'
          then it defaults to a lineto, not another moveto.</li>

          <li>Add a python font.saveNamelist(filename)
          command.</li>

          <li>Jakub Steiner thinks it would be a good idea if the
          tool bindings of mouse clicks in the glyph editor were
          sticky across invocations.</li>

          <li>Werner finds a place where the new jstf code was
          corrupting memory.</li>

          <li>Cancelling Element-&gt;Validation-&gt;Set Extremum
          Bound caused a crash.</li>

          <li>When closing a metrics view associated with a CID
          keyed font, ff would crash.</li>

          <li>Someone wanted to be able to set both the left and
          right side bearings at the same time.</li>

          <li>Patch by Alexey to unlink bitmap code.</li>

          <li>Barry points out it would be better to use fputs when
          I use fprintf.</li>

          <li>If the user didn't have freetype, then the
          anti-aliased metrics view was faint.</li>

          <li>Oops, could write but not read styleset names from a
          feature file.</li>

          <li>Show Att didn't display cursive anchor positioning
          anchor classes properly.</li>

          <li>Panov wants a python function to determine the extent
          in the x direction of a contour when y is fix. That is,
          the minimum and maximum values x can attain for a given
          y. And vice versa.

            <p>Extend this a little so the user can specify a range
            of y values (return the extent in x when y is between
            ybottom and ytop).</p>

            <ul>
              <li>contour.xBoundsAtY(ybottom[,ytop])</li>

              <li>contour.yBoundsAtX(xleft[,xright])</li>

              <li>layer.xBoundsAtY(ybottom[,ytop])</li>

              <li>layer.yBoundsAtX(xleft[,xright])</li>
            </ul>

            <p>And that appears not to be what he wants anyway. Oh
            well.</p>
          </li>

          <li>Dave wants a python function to return a random text
          string.

            <ul>
              <li>font.randomText(script[,lang])</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>If ff opened a bad bitmap font file and tried to
          place it in a font's background layer, ff would
          crash.</li>

          <li>Adjusting the Previous Control Point from the Get
          Info (point) window of an HVCurve point had very odd
          effects.</li>

          <li>Ubuntu now checks that if you use "%3$s" in a sprintf
          format string you must also use "%1$" and "%2$".</li>

          <li>Patch by Nicolas Spalinger improving OFL
          tooltip.</li>

          <li>Patch by Andrey Panov to add GetAnchorPoints to
          legacy scripting.</li>

          <li>Widhaya Trisarnwadhana points out that the mnemonic
          _N is bound to two items in the View menu of outline
          glyphs.</li>

          <li>I let people assign any name to glyphs in the private
          use area without destroying the encoding. But due to a
          bug, if you changed the glyph's encoding to the PUA it
          fell into that code and would not change the font's
          encoding either.</li>

          <li>If a point had control points which were less than 1
          em-unit from it, then FF would sometimes think it was a
          curve point when it wasn't. That's probably still true,
          but some of the more egregious cases have been
          fixed.</li>

          <li>Panov suggests that for cubic points, when we round
          them we should not round the locations of the controls
          but should round the distance from the on-curve point.
          Things are a bit trickier for quadratic controls. If the
          on-curve point is interpolated, then obviously the
          controls should be rounded and not the on-curve
          point.</li>

          <li>Exporting bitmap formats chose the wrong format.</li>
        </ul>

              I wish to thank Michal Nowakowski for fixing my bugs
              these last few months. I no longer have as much time
              for FontForge as I have in the past, and my attention
              to the project is spotty.

      <li>8-Apr-2009

        <ul>
          <li>Extensive patch by Alexey Kryukov to support
          composites (references) in bitmap fonts.

            <ul>
              <li>Copy/Paste bitmap references</li>

              <li>Output into sfnts</li>

              <li>sfd extension</li>

              <li>Fix them up so that bitmap formats which don't
              support them have them unlinked</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Support for the JSTF table (sfd extension), new
          dialog <code>Element-&gt;Other
          Info-&gt;Justification</code>.</li>

          <li>Add a set of new python functions for manipulating
          CID keyed fonts:

            <ul>
              <li>cidConvertTo(registry,ordering,supplement)</li>

              <li>cidConvertByCmap(filename)</li>

              <li>cidFlatten()</li>

              <li>cidFlattenByCmap(filename)</li>

              <li>cidInsertBlankSubFont()</li>

              <li>cidRemoveSubFont()</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Add support for reading/writing version 1.8 of
          Adobe's feature file format (while, I hope, retaining the
          ability to read version 1.6). Fix a number of bugs in
          parsing feature files.

            <p>FontForge now supports the 'BASE' table (in feature
            files).</p>

            <p>The new format is considerably better than the old
            and can now be used to express almost all of
            OpenType.</p>

            <p>Changes:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>ability to name anchors and value records and use
              them later.</li>

              <li>contourpoints used to be expressed as
              "&lt;contourpoint 2&gt;" and are now expressed as
              "contourpoint 2" (no brokets). Adobe does not mention
              this in the changelog. [Incompatible change]</li>

              <li>It is now possible to specify a GDEF mark
              attachment class in the lookupflags statement.</li>

              <li>The syntax for mark to base/ligature/mark lookups
              is completely different. [Incompatible change]</li>

              <li>The syntax for contextual lookups has been
              extended to allow them to reference lookups by name.
              [FontForge has always done this. When I suggested to
              Adobe that they follow suit they said they would not.
              They have now followed suit but have used an
              incompatible syntax to accomplish the same ends. So
              this is an Incompatible change for FontForge]</li>

              <li>The syntax for contextual lookups has been
              extended to allow for the new mark lookups.</li>

              <li>It is now possible to specify a reverse chaining
              substitution lookup.</li>

              <li>It is now possible to specify descriptive names
              for the ss00-ss99 features. FontForge doesn't support
              this but will parse and ignore it</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Last release Werner asked me to put in checks for
          glyphs that exceded various limits in the font (glyphs
          outside the bounding box, glyphs with advance widths
          bigger than the max, etc.) The problem is that erroneous
          fonts often have thousands of these errors, so only
          report once -- unless they turn on fontlint.</li>

          <li>Fix several problems with simplifying quadratic
          splines.</li>

          <li>Could still get control points pointing diametrically
          opposite their desired position when converting cubics to
          quadratics (happened when we could not find a good
          solution by subdividing the spline and had to try another
          approach).</li>

          <li>AddExtrema could go into an infinite loop.</li>

          <li>Barry points out that when converting something to a
          CID font through a CMAP the last glyph in the encoding
          will be lost.</li>

          <li>Some inconsistancies in ff python docs and
          reality.</li>

          <li>The regen bitmaps dlg sometimes did not use freetype
          for all glyphs.</li>

          <li>Metrics view had problems with cid fonts.</li>

          <li>FontForge was supposed to check that the compile time
          (include file) freetype library version number matched
          the installed version number. But it didn't. Only matters
          in the debugger, but is important there.</li>

          <li>Autoinstructor: fixed a hang reported by Andrey V.
          Panov.</li>

          <li>Autoinstructor: patch from Alexey:

            <ul>
              <li>More tweaking to diagonal stems.</li>

              <li>Added support to horizontal ghost hints not tied
              to blue zones and vertical ghost hints.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Barry points out a free which is sometimes
          inappropriate.</li>

          <li>The transform function from the fontview (and python)
          would transform images in the background layer multiple
          times -- once for each selected layer.</li>

          <li>Autoinstructor: patch from Alexey:

            <ul>
              <li>Fix an issue reported by Andrey V. Panov (counter
              control again).</li>

              <li>One type of dependent stems were positioned with
              wrong method; resulting in serifs pushed beyond their
              blue zones and other quirks.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Fix a crash bug in the math kern dlg.</li>

          <li>If a tt control point were on top of an on-curve
          point, then ff would ignore it. So when I read things in
          I moved it, slightly. But that didn't work, because the
          instructions would do the wrong thing with it, and if it
          were part of an interpolated sequence that info would be
          garbled. So only swallow control points if they don't
          have a nextcpindex.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>24-Feb-2009

        <ul>
          <li>Support for UFO version 2.</li>

          <li>If a CID font contained a ".notdef" glyph, then when
          FF generated a Type1 CID font resource from it, FF would
          omit the .notdef glyph.</li>

          <li>Patch from Panov to allow legacy scripting to guess
          values for the private dictionary.
          PrivateGuess(key).</li>

          <li>Werner wants to know what version of freetype ff is
          using. So the debug window now shows this on the info
          line (I presume that's where it is most important).</li>

          <li>Andreas Neustifter provided a FontForge icon with a
          transparent background (or the mac).</li>

          <li>In TrueType debugging Werner originally asked to mark
          pixels which changed state. (So there were four states:
          on and still on, just recently turned on, just recently
          turned off, always off). Now he'd like to see exactly the
          current state.</li>

          <li>People complain that under window managers that try
          to behave like MS Windows, the palettes slowly walk off
          the screen. This patch should (almost) fix that. A
          palette may start to walk off but each time it does, it
          will be brought back close to the zero point.</li>

          <li>Pango doesn't like a utf8 string which consists
          solely of a variation selector. So don't draw them.</li>

          <li>Werner doesn't want to see anchor points when
          debugging.</li>

          <li>Change weight from the fontview usually crashed.</li>

          <li>In the past if someone had a glyph with a negative
          advance width, FF would output a large positive number to
          the 'hmtx' table, instead output 0.</li>

          <li>Yet another undo problem caused by the [Apply] button
          in the expand stroke dlg. This one on cancelling the
          dlg.</li>

          <li>Werner wants to see what points the current
          instruction is going to move, so when debugging highlight
          these points. Also draw circles around the points which
          are used as reference points.</li>

          <li>FF needed libxml to compile.</li>

          <li>If there were no undoes in a glyph then Expand Stroke
          would crash.</li>

          <li>Werner suggests adding a check that advance widths
          are all less than hhea.advanceWidthMax</li>

          <li>Ah. Werner wants ff to tell him when an isFixedPitch
          font has a glyph with an andvance width which differs
          from advanceWidthMax.</li>

          <li>Add a check that glyphs are within the font's
          bounding box too.</li>

          <li>When creating a metrics view with many glyphs, one of
          which needed to be autohinted, then ff might crash.</li>

          <li>Width was not set when building some small-caps
          glyphs out of references.</li>

          <li>When I boxified Page Setup a typo meant that one
          radio button occurred twice and another got lost.
          Resulting in -- a crash.</li>

          <li>Some dialogs don't get destroyed after they are
          finished with. Instead they hang around, invisible,
          containing state information that becomes relevant next
          time they appear. They need to be able to change their
          transient_for hints, since they may pop up with a new
          owner window.</li>

          <li>Points of extrema weren't being marked correctly in
          the glyph view.</li>

          <li>Mark to ligature anchor points not output properly to
          feature files.</li>

          <li>Another member problem in merge fonts.</li>

                  Apple appears to have shipped a buggy version of
                  X11 with 10.5. The problem appears fixed in
                  10.5.6 (It may have been fixed earlier, but I
                  don't have a machine on which I can test that).

                  <p>The problem only affects fontforge it if uses
                  pango or cairo.</p>

                  <p>This release of fontforge tries to check for a
                  buggy system, and if it thinks it is running on
                  one, then it will refuse to use Pango and
                  Cairo.</p>

                  <p>The problem does not affect Mac 10.4.*</p>
                  <hr />
                  You may upgrade from 10.5 to 10.5.6 by going to
                  the Apple Menu and selecting the "Software
                  Update" menu item, and then the "Mac OS X Update
                  Combined".

                  <p>You probably need to install X11
                  <strong>before</strong> you upgrade the Operating
                  System.</p>

          <li>Fix more memory problems in Merge Fonts.</li>

          <li>If a font were missing a .notdef glyph. If the user
          tried to display a font sample of text which included a
          character not in the font. Then (after the recent patches
          for grid-fit metrics in Print dlg) fontforge would
          crash.</li>

          <li>Fix a bug in old cubic to quadratic conversion.</li>

          <li>Lots of changes to extrema code.

            <ol>
              <li>Find problems and add extrema had different defn
              of "short" splines (ones which could have extrema) so
              we'd get conflicting behavior.</li>

              <li>FontView add extrema couldn't be undone.</li>

              <li>Many improvements in the algorithm. Too worried
              of rounding errors before.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>Initializing the font info dialog crashed on the mac
          when -O2 was specified during configure (the default
          situation).</li>

          <li>After adding an Apply button the Transform dlg would
          crash if invoked in a glyph with no undoes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>15-Dec-2008

        <ul>
          <li>Add an <a href="resedit.html">X resource
          editor</a>.</li>

          <li>Make the metrics view be more like the display dlg in
          that you can specify a point-size/dpi to view stuff (also
          include increment/decrement pointsize). Fix Display dlg
          so that it passes freetype a point size/dpi combination
          rather than the (almost) equivalent pixelsize.</li>

          <li>Patch by "JustFillBug" to exend python scripting by
          making the find interator become a find/replace
          iterator.</li>

          <li>Patch by Taco to fix a memory problem reading bad
          baseline data.</li>

          <li>Patch from Andrey PANOV to extend GlyphInfo (legacy
          scripting) by adding "XProfile" and "YProfile"
          options.</li>

          <li>Add an [Apply] button to the transform and expand
          stroke dialogs in the outline view. (Request from
          Andrey).</li>

          <li>Make ff parse preference files independent of the
          decimal point local in which they were written (that is
          -- accept either "." or "," in floating numbers).</li>

          <li>If a Cubic layer had a notdef glyph, then sometimes,
          rasterizing using freetype would fail (not a freetype
          problem, I didn't set things up right).</li>

          <li>Fix one more problems with points being snapped to a
          wrong stem side (it was still possible in case of
          off-curve points).</li>

          <li>Metrics View and Display dlg weren't showing grid fit
          metrics properly. Several bugs.</li>

          <li>FF used to shift glyphs left if "build accented"
          created something with a large enough negative left side
          bearing (ie. generally when centering a large accent over
          an "I"). Panov doesn't like this.</li>

          <li>Change so that only modal dialogs are marked
          transient. Make sure everybody is marked as a dlg.</li>

          <li>FF got confused by format 4 cmaps which weren't
          unicode.</li>

          <li>Goto dlg would not test altunis when looking for a
          unicode code point.</li>

          <li>If a langsys table had a required feature, then ff
          would drop one feature from the list of features. This
          omitted feature should have been the required one (which
          is marked specially), but wasn't always.</li>

          <li>In my eternal vigilence against rounding errors I
          failed to report some intersections which were very close
          to the end points.</li>

          <li>Change the contour direction tester so that instead
          of looking at the first part of the contour it sees, make
          it check the whole thing, so if there are
          self-intersections we will get inconsistent results.
          Change everyone who looks at the direction tester to be
          prepared for an error return.</li>

          <li>In the glyph view, add the option to check for
          self-intersections before calculating whether a contour
          is clockwise or anti-. However, this check can be
          extremely slow for complex glyphs (those with lots of
          splines) so include an option to turn it off.</li>

          <li>Add the extension ".lzma" to the list of compression
          styles that ff is prepared to deal with.</li>

          <li>patch by Taco for sfnts with no understandable
          encoding.</li>

          <li>Patch by Panov to add a new scritping command
          SelectGlyphsBoth.</li>

          <li>loading of Apple gvar fonts broken.</li>

          <li>Redo all the default font family names we ask for.
          For example "Helvetica" is provided by X11 bitmaps, but
          not by fontconfig. Now provide a set of names for each
          family grouping which will work with either font
          provider.</li>

          <li>Back before supporting multiple layers, the transform
          dlg had an entry "Transform Background too", that should
          be changed to "Transform all layers".</li>

          <li>When doing a "Scale Emsize", glyphs containing
          references with UseMyMetrics set were not set to the
          correct width if the refered glyph occured later in the
          encoding.</li>

          <li>Change the definition of FontView.FontSize. Used to
          be in pixels. Make it be in points.</li>

          <li>We could get into infinite recursion when CVChar and
          DVChar each passed non-latin characters to the other in
          hopes the other could handle it. Neither could. They kept
          calling deeper and deeper.</li>

          <li>Add some more checks for badly numbered glyphs.</li>

          <li>Memory problems with merge:

            <ul>
              <li>Counter masks</li>

              <li>Diagonal stems</li>

              <li>Mismatch layers</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Memory bug when copying contextual chaining
          lookups.</li>

          <li>Scrolling the GPOS/GSUB lookups panes for font info
          cause lots of nasty flickering.</li>

          <li>The text fields in the metrics view (right, left
          bearings, width, kern, etc) drew black text on top of a
          black selection. It wasn't legible.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>17-Nov-2008

        <ul>
          <li>Displaying magnified bitmap strikes in the font view
          often caused a crash.</li>

          <li>Non-English translations of "%d pixel bitmap" in the
          View menu of the font view came out garbled. There were
          interpreted as latin1 rather than utf8</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>15-Nov-2008

        <ul>
          <li>FontForge will now use libpango and libcairo if these
          libraries are present. Pango provides support for drawing
          opentype text in any language, so it should now be
          possible to provide po files for the Arabic and Indic
          languages. Pango also draws anti-aliased text so the user
          interface should look nicer.

            <p>Cairo will draw anti-aliased lines and splines (and
            text as well). Cairo also supports translucent
            colors.</p>

            <p>If you have an old release of pango then it may not
            be able to draw on top of cairo, in which case you
            won't see complex scripts drawn properly in the outline
            glyph view (the only view in which cairo is
            active).</p>

            <p>Start up is slower with either Pango or Cairo active
            because both use fontconfig to initialize stuff and
            that can take time.</p>

            <p>Cairo, and to a lesser extent, Pango can slow down
            drawing. Especially if you use X across a wire (on a
            display not connected to your computer). The slowdown
            depends to some extent on your video card, driver, X
            release, etc. If you find these libraries too slow to
            be useable you may turn either off in Preferences. (You
            may also turn them off at configure time).</p>

            <p>The first time fontforge starts with pango (I think
            it's pango) enabled, initialization is very slow --
            several minutes -- do not be alarmed, it only happens
            once.</p>

            <p>Pango crashes on my cygwin system, so my cygwin
            build does not ship with either pango or cairo.</p>

            <p>The version of cairo available from fink on the mac
            (1.0) is too old for it to work with fontforge (which
            needs at least 1.2). So the mac builds do not ship with
            cairo.</p>

            <p>The default initialization of fontconfig on the mac
            doesn't seem to find any fonts. You should create a
            ~/.fonts directory and drop into it the fonts you want
            to be displayed.</p>
          </li>

          <li>Updated Polish, Greek and Russian translations.

            <p>Created a teeny tiny translation file for
            Malayalam.</p>
          </li>

          <li>Change the image import dlg to display jpegs by
          default.</li>

          <li>Show gridfit omitted a round to int when displaying
          grid fit outlines. If you use 72dpi, then all was fine,
          otherwise there would be a slight difference between
          where the outline was and where it should have been.</li>

          <li>Remove the preference item to specify a pixmap
          directory. Instead allow the user to specify a pixmap
          search path with X resources.
          <code>Gdraw.GGadgets.ImagePath</code></li>

          <li>Many new X resources:

            <ul>
              <li>GComboBox.Box...</li>

              <li>GComboBoxMenu.Box...</li>

              <li>GNumericField.Box...</li>

              <li>GNumericFieldSpinner.Box...</li>

              <li>fontforge.View.Background.</li>

              <li>...Box.GradientBG</li>

              <li>...Box.GradientStartCol</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>All dialogs should now be marked as transient for
          tiling window managers (I'm told). But a few dialogs
          weren't even marked as dialogs.</li>

          <li>Boxify the Print Setup dialog.</li>

          <li>Doing a print sample of a truetype font produced bad
          CID output.</li>

          <li>Widths of dependent glyphs where not changed by
          changing the rbearing of a glyph in the metrics
          view.</li>

          <li>Force a reflow of the TeX box when the user changes
          from TeX Text to TeX Math. The labels change, and in
          polish the label gets so long it hides under the text
          field.</li>

          <li>Boxify the TeX More Params dialog of fontinfo.</li>

          <li>When a point was exactly midway between its control
          points, FontForge would not detect that it was a curve
          point after recent work. As this happens frequently in
          TrueType (all interpolated points) we shouldn't do
          that.</li>

          <li>Fix some more cases where the "link" buttons in the
          FontInfo-&gt;UnicodeRanges and Generate Fonts dlgs looked
          wrong.</li>

          <li>FontForge has been generating bad bounding box
          information for BDF fonts.</li>

          <li>Adobe doesn't define how big a spline must be for the
          "no extrema" restriction to apply. Phillip Poll suggests
          that fontforge have a command that defines this on a
          per-font basis. Element-&gt;Validation-&gt;Set Extremum
          Bound.</li>

          <li>More accurate catagorization of whether a point is
          curve or tangent.</li>

          <li>Sequence/Lookup dlg of contextual lookup dlgs can be
          too small.</li>

          <li>Michal points out some strings which are not
          translated.</li>

          <li>Michal points out that the [Default using suffix]
          button in the single substitution subtable dialog didn't
          work if the lookup were bound to no features.</li>

          <li>Add a lock icon beside a reference name if that
          reference has "use-my-metrics" set.</li>

          <li>If a quadratic glyph is put into spiro mode,
          modified, and then put back into bezier mode then it
          LOOKS as if it is still quadratic (there are interpolated
          points shown) but it is actually cubic.</li>

          <li>If someone changed the button shape to round rect,
          then the link button in Font Info-&gt;Unicode Ranges
          became a blot.</li>

          <li>Alexey suggests using typo-line-gap between lines in
          the print dialog.</li>

          <li>Alexey also provides a patch to fix the old church
          slavonic sample text in the print dialog and a couple of
          other issues.</li>

          <li>Patch by Kanou. SetPanose in legacy scripting did not
          set the panose_set bit so all changes were lost.</li>

          <li>Added duplicate name and duplicate unicode to the
          things validate checks for.</li>

          <li>Add a command to set the color of all selected
          glyphs.</li>

          <li>Give instructions in Find Problems on how to figure
          out which two glyphs have the same name, or the same
          unicode code point.</li>

          <li>Pango has caniptions if I ask it to draw one of the
          code points reserved for surrogates or some of the "NOT A
          UNICODE CHARACTER" codepoints (0xffff, etc.). So don't
          draw these, and mark them as unusable slots instead.</li>

          <li>Redo the selection menu in the font view.

            <ul>
              <li>If the user holds down the shift key then the
              selection is enlarged by any glyphs specified in the
              command. (logical or)</li>

              <li>If the user holds down the control key then any
              glyphs specified by the command are removed from the
              selection.</li>

              <li>If the user has both shift and control down then
              only glyphs currently selected and specified by the
              command will remain selected (logical and)</li>

              <li>Otherwise the selection is set to what is
              specifed by the command.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Add new commands to select glyphs which</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Contain nothing by references</li>

              <li>Contain nothing by splines</li>

              <li>Contain both splines and references (bad
              idea)</li>

              <li>Are whitespace (and contain neither splines nor
              references).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>The print dialog had a nasty habit of crashing when
          asked to undo.</li>

          <li>Off by one error with scrollbar would sometimes hide
          the last line in the print dialog.</li>

          <li>Lines of text in the Insert Text Outlines dialog were
          drawn in the reverse order from that shown in the dialog
          (ie. top line on the bottom).</li>

          <li>Fix a crash bug in the print dialog.</li>

          <li>It used to be that if a glyph had instructions, and
          the background was order2, then editing the background
          (or any order2 background layer) would clear the
          instructions.</li>

          <li>Peter Baker says:

            <blockquote>
              In both "Show Grid Fit" and the TT debugger it used
              to be possible to turn off the display of outlines in
              the foreground layer simply by unchecking "fore". Now
              it can no longer be done, and as a result it's become
              more difficult to check at a glance the overall
              effect of TT instructions. It would be nice to have
              this capability back.
            </blockquote>
          </li>

          <li>HV points don't work well with quadratic splines. Too
          many cases where they just specify an impossiblility.
          Attempt to improve on that. Merge on quadratic splines
          also left much to be desired.</li>

          <li>When FF starts browsing the OFLib it creates a thread
          which requests the new state of OFLib (ie. any fonts
          since last time I looked?). This thread should die after
          it has read all the new stuff. It did die, but then
          someone restarted it and the whole process repeated.
          Which might be ok -- we'd get a new state whenever the
          site changed -- except that it meant a flicker of the
          display every minute or so.</li>

          <li>Nicolas Spalinger points out that a license search in
          the oflib dialog (of fontforge) finds exactly the
          opposite of what was asked for (searching for PD finds
          OFL and vice versa).</li>

          <li>There exist sfds where the width of a glyph does not
          match that specified by use my metrics on references. So
          when we read these guys in, fix up the erroneous widths
          and complain.</li>

          <li>Distributions no longer provide .so files -- unless
          you ask for -dev packages, and sometimes those don't
          exist. This means that dlopening a library doesn't work.
          I think that's really stupid on the distibutioner's part.
          What do they gain by removing the .so file? But I won't
          even try to change their minds. Instead try to open the
          appropriate foo.so.? file if we can't find foo.so (Not
          always, but in the more important cases).</li>

          <li>When deleting a mark-to-mark anchor class, then any
          mark glyph which had both a base mark anchor point and a
          normal mark anchor point would have only one of them
          deleted. The other would be a sort of ghost point
          pointing to an anchor class that didn't exist and causing
          problems.</li>

          <li>Jason Pagura points out that while the short cuts in
          menus may be changed by the user, the short cuts which
          appear in windows without menus may not be. So
          Cut/Copy/Paste in textfields always use Cntl-X/C/V rather
          than Cmd-X/C/V. Fix this.</li>

          <li>Add a resource to let the user set the background
          color of selected glyphs in the fontview. Then Alexey
          wanted a way to set the foreground color of selected
          glyphs.</li>

          <li>Points could be snapped to a wrong edge of a
          non-ghost stem controlling a blue zone.</li>

          <li>Put in code to complain when a font contains a hint
          mask with bits set indicative of hints which have not
          been defined.</li>

          <li>When generating random text for a font in the print
          dlg, FF would alocate one character to few and trample
          memory.</li>

          <li>Prefs file was treating hvoffset as a float rather
          than an int.</li>

          <li>Patch by Michal to allow user control over whether
          points are snapped to pixels in charview, or whether we
          get sub-pixel positioning (and fuzzy lines).</li>

          <li>Markers for lines/curves which are almost, but not
          quite, horizontal or vertical.</li>

          <li>The french translation of the Unicode Names List
          database changed encodings from latin1 to utf8 when they
          came out with version 5.0, and I didn't notice.</li>

          <li>Alexej provides some new preferences for truetype
          hinting:

            <ul>
              <li>InstructDiagonalStems -- Generate instructions
              for diagonal stem hints</li>

              <li>InstructSerifs -- Try to detect serifs and other
              elements protruding from base stems and generate
              instructions for them.</li>

              <li>InstructBallTerminals -- Generate instructions
              for ball terminals</li>

              <li>InterpolateStrongPoints-- Interpolate between
              stem edges some important points, not affected by
              other instructions.</li>

              <li>CounterControl -- Make sure similar or equal
              counters remain the same in gridfitted outlines.
              Enabling this option may result in glyph advance
              widths being inconsistently scaled at some PPEMs</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>Many problems when numbering points in glyphs with
          references.</li>

          <li>Back in Feb, Werner gave me clear instructions on how
          to handle fonts where bit one of 'head'.flags was unset.
          I did something I thought was equivalent, but which
          wasn't. The result broke some glyphs in the "Vista
          fonts". Let's try doing what he said to do instead.</li>

          <li>Autoinstructor: some fixes to strong point
          optimizer.</li>

          <li>Old bug still exists for monospaced fonts. Glyphs
          were positioned at 65,000+ rather than with a negative
          left side bearing.</li>

          <li>Autoinstructor: some points didn't really need to be
          touched by 'strong point' interpolation.</li>

          <li>Be a little more careful about TeX pk and gf files in
          the openfont dlg. Alexej points out that .*gf also
          matches .xgf.</li>

          <li>It used to be that when we changed glyphs in a
          charview we would turn off gridfit. Now it will simply
          refigure gridfit info for the new glyph.</li>

          <li>Make it so that moving a point around will not turn
          off grid fit.</li>

          <li>Andy Balholm points out that Help-&gt;Help often
          fails on the mac because DYLD_LIBARY_PATH points to
          /sw/lib which often contains libjpeg.so which conflicts
          with apple's libjpeg.so which means oascript doesn't work
          to invoke things. Undefine it before trying to open the
          help file.</li>

          <li>make acorn2sfd work again.</li>

          <li>When an svg font specified kerning with more than one
          glyph name in glyph1 or 2 then ff would create a kerning
          by class thing ... except it didn't do any of the
          checking needed to insure that we were given a valid set
          of glyph classes, and so generally produced garbage. Just
          make lots of kern pairs.</li>

          <li>When processing svg arc commands (in a path) we could
          get rounding errors that lead to NANs. Clip the range so
          that doesn't happen.</li>

          <li>Add font.importBitmaps to python scripting.</li>

          <li>the cli argument "--library-status" was broken.</li>

          <li>A couple of important textfields were not using an
          input context and were limited to ASCII (probably) when
          they should not have been. Font Comment, lookup name,
          etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>27-Sept-2008

        <ul>
          <li>Implement a concept of "master counters" (similar to
          PS counter hints, but more flexibe). I. e. if there are
          two or more equal or similar counters in the glyph, then
          references pointing to stems forming the first counter
          are added to stems forming the subsequent counters. This
          can be used to implement a sort of counter control in the
          autoinstructor.

            <p>Adjust the width to length ratio used to determine
            if a diagonal stem is acceptable.</p>
          </li>

          <li>There appears to be (what I consider to be) a bug in
          scim. If the Mod2Mask bit is set in the event then it
          returns a keysym of 0. Other input managers do not do
          this. And some input managers depend on having that bit
          set (it is used on the Mac for Option processing for
          example). The upshot is that if I want to do mnemonics
          (Alt/Meta key sets Mod2Mask) I must clear this bit when
          passing info to scim. Since I don't know what input
          manager is attached I must clear the bit for all
          managers. Which breaks some of them.</li>

          <li>When doing completion in a textfield, if ff completed
          the entire string, then it would not select the
          unexpected stuff. The result would be that I would type
          "a", then "." and ff would complete to "a.sc" (rather
          than "a.<span class="c9">sc</span>") so when I typed the
          "s" I would get "a.scs" rather than "a.s<span class=
          "c9">c</span>".</li>

          <li>Add code to allow users to customize the font used in
          various dialogs and windows which previously could not be
          customized.</li>

          <li>Multiple Master dlg was very broken.</li>

          <li>Saving and Reading quadradic splines to the
          'PfEd'.'layr' subtable didn't work.

            <p>Also if we didn't save the background layer
            (layer=0) then a random layer would (inappropriately)
            become the background.</p>

            <p>Extend the 'layr' format to store a
            background/foreground flag per layer.</p>
          </li>

          <li>Still problems in importing lookups on 64bit
          machines.</li>

          <li>A <a href="http://typophile.com/node/49550">thread on
          typophile</a> exposes my ignorance. The x-height of an
          italic font is usually a little less than that of it's
          companion roman font. (This is to correct for an optical
          illusion, because vertical stems are slanted in italic
          they will be longer than the corresponding stem in an
          upright font, and to the human eye they will look taller
          (even though they are not)). So add an option to the
          Italic dialog to make the x-height a little smaller.</li>

          <li>Change the menu handler so it can draw mac menu icons
          (cloverleaf for command, up arrow for shift, ^ for
          control and weird squiggly for option).<br />
            <img src="MenuWithMacIcons.png" width="104" height=
            "38" /> <img src="MenuWithoutMacIcons.png" width="125"
            height="38" />

            <p>Remove the hack that if the modifier mask for the
            command key was set then we'd also set the control mask
            (this meant that the command key would work as control,
            but it meant it could only work as control).</p>

            <p>Let the command key work as itself, and put in
            special code to check whether X11 is going to give us
            the command key (or will that key be used in the X11's
            own menubar). If we get command then we load a special
            set of keymap bindings (which, presumably, will use
            command). If we don't find a special set of keymaps,
            then fall back on normal processing.</p>
          </li>

          <li>Make the pixelsize in anchor control be saved in
          prefs file (clean up prefs file for scripting, bring up
          to date).</li>

          <li>We didn't have any way to remove an sfnt table (like
          'fpgm') even though we tell the user to do exactly that
          in the auto instructor.</li>

          <li>Was not allocating enough memory for comments in the
          cvt table structure when user did a [Change Length].</li>

          <li>Patch by Thomas ?. When FF loaded a ufo font
          (actually any glyf file) it used integers for the
          coordinates instead of reals.</li>

          <li>We used to move left and right point coordinates to
          the baseline for italic stems, so that they may well fall
          outside of the glyph bounding box. So prevent the
          situation where this could lead to a nan in spline
          creation. Also don't change the slope of italic stems
          when resizing a glyph.</li>

          <li>Clear should only clear anchors, hints and tt
          instructions if it is the last foreground layer. We could
          get picky and clear hints when the last cubic foreground
          layer went, and instructions whent he last quadratic
          layer went, but I don't think it is worth the
          bother.</li>

          <li>If we have a 'TYP1' sfnt with a kern table which
          kerns a glyph with no unicode encoding, then FF would
          likely crash.</li>

          <li>Oops. Typo in Generic change function. Crashed when
          doing change glyph on a glyph with only references</li>

          <li>Just as the paste command should only set the width
          in foreground layers if all other foreground layers are
          empty, so the clear command should only reset the width
          in similar conditions.</li>

          <li>Internal conversion from fontforge splinesets to ff
          python contours would often leave interpolated points
          showing in the contour.</li>

          <li>When FF generated a default name for a lookup when
          adding a new lookup from font info, that lookup index was
          always set to 0, which meant multiple lookups for the
          same feature would stand a good chance of getting the
          same default name. Do a little better.</li>

          <li>Extend the small caps dlg to create petite caps if
          desired.</li>

          <li>Fix an uninitialized variable in
          GXDrawGrabSelection.</li>

          <li>FF would attach a mark to the first anchor point in
          the correct subtable in the base glyph. It would not
          check for the correct anchor class.</li>

          <li>Python contour conversions would often introduce a
          control point on a linear order2 spline.</li>

          <li>List of Panose letterforms was missing an entry from
          the middle so all later entries were off by one.</li>

          <li>"Fore" and "Back" weren't localized in one
          significant place.</li>

          <li>Add a few more checks (when reading in) on the
          validity of the 'MATH' table.</li>

          <li>FF would generate a bad MATH table if given a glyph
          with assembly data but no variant sizes.</li>

          <li>Dropping a drag and drop into the metricsview after
          the last character tried to insert the drop before the
          first character.

            <p>Clean up drag and drop from the font view a bit.</p>
          </li>

          <li>I have been trying to attach marks to bases
          backwards. It is the mark which moves, so the attachment
          should happen when we get to the mark, and we should look
          backwards to find the base. I have been finding the base,
          and then walking forward to find the mark.

            <p>My approach failed if the lookup contains multiple
            subtables and a base glyph has two marks being
            attached, one from each subtable -- I would attach the
            mark in the first subtable, but then having found a
            subtable that worked would stop, and the second mark
            never got attached.</p>
          </li>

          <li>When dragging and dropping lookups, allow dropping a
          lookup subtable into a different lookup of the same font
          (assuming it's got the right lookup type).</li>

          <li>The recent patch to insure that [Imported] lookups
          from one font to another came across in the right order
          didn't work if there were nested lookups involved. The
          order of nested lookups is irrelevant -- unless they are
          also used in a non-nested context.</li>

          <li>Add the ability to define a "Group" by glyph
          color.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>28-August-2008

        <ul>
          <li>The Layers pane of Font Info randomly wrote memory
          when it was initialize. This could cause crashes, and who
          knows what weird behavior.</li>

          <li>Validate spent half its time validating the
          foreground layer and half validating the current layer.
          This could cause crashes if the current layer was not the
          foreground.</li>

          <li>Fixed a bug in parsing old style CID files. (those
          with type1 charstrings)</li>

          <li>FontForge's OpenType layout engine probably didn't do
          the right thing in anchor positioning of mark-to-base
          lookups when the base glyph had been moved by a previous
          GPOS lookup.</li>

          <li>Still missing some unicode ranges from 5.1.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>25-August-2008

        <ul>
          <li>Turn off debugging if the user switches layers.</li>

          <li>The truetype debugger really wanted to debug the
          foreground layer and not any other.</li>

          <li>When validating a font, and double clicking to bring
          up find problems in a charview, then the layer setting of
          find problems was (usually) incorrect.</li>

          <li>Add a command font.correctReferences() to python
          scripting to fixup cases of mixed outlines and references
          (outlines get moved into a newly created glyph and then a
          reference will be made to it). Also fix cases where the
          transformation matrix can't be expressed in truetype
          (scaling by 2 or more, for example).</li>

          <li>Barry points out a typo introduced in the background
          layers patch which would cause crashes in fonts with many
          layers.</li>

          <li>Minor improvements and bugfixes in resolving stem
          conflicts. Also, lists of HV stems are now built in
          stemdb.c, so rely on these data instead of doing a double
          work in autohint.c.</li>
