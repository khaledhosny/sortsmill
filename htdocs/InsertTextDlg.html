    <h1 class="c1">The Insert Text Dialog</h1>

    <p><img src="InsertTxtDlg.png" align="right" width="474"
    height="410" />Generally when designing a font you will not
    want to use this dialog. What is the point of a glyph which is
    made up of precomposed text?</p>

    <p>But occasionally it is useful. A company's logo might want
    to live in a single glyph.</p>

    <p>This dialog looks rather like the <a href=
    "display.html">print dialog</a>. You may enter text, display it
    in a given font, and at a desired pointsize. You may apply
    OpenType features.</p>

    <p>Once you have composed your text, you may insert it into a
    glyph. The text will be insert as the outlines of the
    characters you entered. In the simplest case, the text will
    much as you entered them at the origin of the glyph.</p>

    <p class="c2"><img src="TextUnbound.png" width="290" height=
    "76" /></p>

    <p>The text will be scaled. If you entered the text with a
    pointsize of 12, then the outlines will be scaled so that the
    em-size is 12. If you use a font where the em-size is 1000, and
    the character "H" is 662, then after scaling the "H" will be
    12*662/1000 = 7.9 units high.</p>

    <p>(You can, of course, rescale the outlines once they are in
    the glyph).</p>

    <p>If you enter a lot of text, it will wrap. The dialog shows
    the length of the longest line, and the location at which text
    will wrap.</p>

    <p>Complications arise if you select a path in the glyph before
    invoking the Insert Text dialog -- then you can bind the text
    you enter so that it curves with the path. You can have
    FontForge scale your text so that it exactly fits the path
    length, or you can position your text at the start, middle or
    end of the path. Text is bound so that if the path is a
    horizontal line running from left to right the text will use
    the path as a baseline and be oriented as you would expect for
    left to right text, if the path is a horizontal line running
    right to left, then the text will appear up-side-down. If you
    don't want the text to use the path as its baseline (if you'd
    like a gap between the two) then enter a value in "Offset text
    from path"</p>

    <p>Finally FontForge has two modes for binding text. Either it
    will use the place where the center of the glyph aligns on the
    path and rotate the entire glyph appropriately for that point,
    or it will distort each bit of the glyph as is appropriate for
    where that bit aligns on the path. In the first aproach the
    letters are cleaner individually but the text as a whole is
    more jagged.</p>
