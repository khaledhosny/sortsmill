    <b>5.5 How about translating the license and the FAQ into other
    languages?</b>

    <p>SIL certainly recognises the need for people who are not
    familiar with English to be able to understand the OFL and this
    FAQ better in their own language. Making the license very clear
    and readable is a key goal of the OFL.</p>

    <p>If you are an experienced translator, you are very welcome
    to help translating the OFL and its FAQ so that designers and
    users in your language community can understand the license
    better. But only the original English version of the license
    has legal value and has been approved by the community.
    Translations do not count as legal substitutes and should only
    serve as a way to explain the original license. SIL - as the
    author and steward of the license for the community at large -
    does not approve any translation of the OFL as legally valid
    because even small translations ambiguities could be abused and
    create problems.</p>

    <p>We give permission to publish unofficial translations into
    other languages provided that they comply with the following
    guidelines:</p>

    <p>- put the following disclaimer in both English and the
    target language stating clearly that the translation is
    unofficial:</p>

    <blockquote>
      "This is an unofficial translation of the SIL Open Font
      License into $language. It was not published by SIL
      International, and does not legally state the distribution
      terms for fonts that use the OFL. A release under the OFL is
      only valid when using the original English text.

      <p>However, we recognize that this unofficial translation
      will help users and designers not familiar with English to
      understand the SIL OFL better and make it easier to use and
      release font families under this collaborative font design
      model. We encourage designers who consider releasing their
      creation under the OFL to read the FAQ in their own language
      if it is available.</p>

      <p>Please go to http://scripts.sil.org/OFL for the official
      version of the license and the accompanying FAQ."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>- keep your unofficial translation current and update it at
    our request if needed, for example if there is any ambiguity
    which could lead to confusion.</p>

    <p>If you start such a unofficial translation effort of the OFL
    and its accompanying FAQ please let us know, thank you.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><a href="http://scripts.sil.org/OFL_web">The text of the
  current version of the OFL</a>. If anyone is interested in
  translation both the OFL and its FAQ <a href=
  "mailto:fontforge-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">please let me
  know</a> (via mailing list) and I will provide Web space for
  both. I had intended to include these translations in the font's
  'name' table, but have been asked not to because of the possible
  legal ramifications.</p>

  <p>OFL version 1.1 has been released in February 2007 I have
  collected the <a href="OFL-Unofficial.html">following unofficial
  translations</a>.</p>
