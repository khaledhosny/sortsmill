.SH DESCRIPTION
.
The program
.B sortsmill-compare
compares two font files, which may be in any format
.BR sortsmill-editor (1)
can read.
It will notice the following differences:
.
.TP
1)
Characters are present in one font but not in the other.
.
.TP
2)
Characters are present in both fonts but have different sets of outlines
or references.
The outlines may be compared so that only exact matches are accepted, or
so that a fuzzier match is used.
Similarly references may need to match exactly, or may be matched after
an unlink.
.IP
This fuzzy comparison is useful when comparing truetype and postscript
fonts, or when comparing a font with references to one without.
.
.TP
3)
The postscript hints or truetype instructions are different.
.
.TP
4)
The font names (the truetype `name' table) differ.
.
.TP
5)
The kerning (and other `gpos' information) differs.
.
.TP
6)
The ligatures (and other `gsub' information) differ.
.
.TP
7)
Any bitmap strikes present in one font but not in the other.
.
.TP
8)
Any bitmap characters present in one strike of one font but in the
equivalent strike of the other.
.
.TP
9)
Any bitmap characters which differ.
.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Provide a description with a list of the available options.
.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Display the current version.
.
.TP
.B \-\-ignore-hints
Suppress the reporting of hint/instruction differences.
.
.TP
.B \-\-ignore-gpos
Suppress the reporting of kerning (and other `gpos') differences.
.
.TP
.B \-\-ignore-gsub
Suppress the reporting of ligature (and other `gsub') differences.
.
.TP
.B \-\-ignore-names
Suppress the reporting of name string differences.
.
.TP
.B \-\-ignore-bitmaps
Suppress the reporting of bitmap differences.
.
.TP
.B \-\-exact
Require outlines to match exactly. Normally
.B sortsmill-compare
will match contours which
are not exact but where the differences are slight (so you could compare
TrueType and PostScript and get reasonable answers). Also normally
.B sortsmill-compare
will unlink references before it compares (so you can compare a
PostScript font [with no references] to the original source [which
does have references]).
.
.TP
.B \-\-warn
Warn if the outlines/references are slightly different.
.
.TP
.BI \-\-merge "=outfile"
Store a merged version of the two fonts into the specified output file.
The merged data will be based on
.IR fontfile1 ,
as well as any characters present in
.I fontfile2
but not in
.I fontfile1
will be added, and the outlines of
.I fontfile2
will be placed in the background.
Finally, for any characters with different outlines or references the
background of the character will contain the outlines from
.I fontfile2
(references will be unlinked into outlines and those outlines also will be
added).
