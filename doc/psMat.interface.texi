@strong{FIXME:} This chapter needs an introductory section,
for instance describing the tuples that represent
PostScript matrices.


@defun identity ()

Return an identity matrix as a six-element tuple.

@end defun


@defun compose (@var{mat1}, @var{mat2})

Return a matrix that is the composition of two input
transformations.

@end defun


@defun inverse (@var{mat})

Return a matrix which is the inverse of the input
transformation.
(Note: There will not always be an inverse.)

@end defun


@defun rotate (@var{theta})

Return a matrix which will rotate by an angle theta
expressed in radians.

@end defun


@defun scale (@var{x} [ , @var{y}])

Return a matrix that will scale by x horizontally
and y vertically.
If y is omitted, the matrix will scale by x in both
directions.

@end defun


@defun skew (@var{theta})

Return a matrix that will skew by theta
(to produce an oblique font).
Theta is expressed in radians.

@end defun


@defun translate (@var{x}, @var{y})

Return a matrix that will translate by x horizontally
and y vertically.

@end defun
